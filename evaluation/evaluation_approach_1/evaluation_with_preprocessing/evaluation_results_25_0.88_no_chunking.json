        "category": "Application Functionality & Flow",
        "ground_truth": "The Brond Retrains pipeline retrieves `.csv.gz` files via SFTP, renames them with `.LOADED`, parses them using scripts in `/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/`, uploads them to HDFS at `/ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains`, and loads them into the `brond.brond_retrains_hist` Hive table via Oozie workflow `Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW`.",
        "chatbot_answer": " The Brond Retrains pipeline handles raw file ingestion and Hive loading through a series of steps. First, it retrieves raw files from an FTP server using SFTP. These files are then processed, which includes unzipping, parsing, and adding prefixes and suffixes as needed. After processing, the files are loaded into HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) landing zones. From there, they are further loaded into Hive tables, specifically into the `brond.brond_retrains_hist` table. This process ensures that the raw data is properly ingested, processed, and made available for analysis in Hive. \n```",

\"jdbc:hive2://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:10000/default;principal=hive/_HOST@CNE.abc.GR;ssl=true;sslTrustStore=/usr/java/latest/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts;trustStorePassword=changeit\"`\n- Impala-shell: `/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k`\n## Data process: How raw FTP files get into Hive\nStep-by-step process of how retrains data files move from the FTP server to the final Hive table, including renaming, parsing, HDFS upload, and Hive loading.\n1. sftp get raw files (*.csv.gz) from FTP Server to `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n```bash\necho \"ls -l ADSL_Brond\" | sftp bigd@999.999.999.999\n\nsftp> ls -l ADSL_Brond\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 21902115 Nov 28 07:02 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.328_2022_11_28.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 21925249 Nov 29 06:22 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.329_2022_11_29.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 22107252 Nov 30 06:52 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz\n```\n2. rename the raw file(s) in remdef SFTP server by adding the suffix .LOADED\n`echo \"rename /ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz /ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz.LOADED\" | sftp -oport=22 bigd@999.999.999.999`\n3. unzip raw files using `gzip -d` command in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n4. parsing raw files in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n- removes the headers (1st line)\n- removes double-qudefs chars\n- defines the PAR_DT value from the filename (i.e. Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz convert to 20221130)\n- add the prefix `RETR___` to raw file\n- add the suffix `<load time>.parsed` to raw file  \nLoad time format:`<YYYYMMDD_HHMISS>`  \ni.e. `RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed`\n5. put raw files into HDFS landingzone\n`hdfs dfs -put /data/1/brond_retr_LZ/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed /ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed`\n6. clean-up any copy of the raw files from local filesystem  \n`/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`  \n`/shared/brond_retr_repo`  \n7. load HDFS files into hive table `brond.brond_retrains_hist`\n`beeline -e \"LOAD DATA INPATH '/ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE brond.brond_retrains_hist PARTITION (par_dt='20221130')\"`\n8. execute compute stats using impala-shell  \n```bash\n/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k\t\ncompute incremental stats brond.brond_retrains_hist;\n```\nIn the event where multiple files are transfered (files refer to the same data), we proceed with overwriting data in brond table. Deletion of those multiple files is abc's responsibility.\n## Monitoring\nHow the pipeline\u2019s execution is tracked using monitoring logs and component-level messages.\n### Monitoring connection

Login to https://999.999.999.999:8888/hue/accounts/login?next=/hue using the brond account\n2. Go to \"Jobs\" > \"Workflows\"\nIf all workflow executions (\"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\") were successful, you can proceed by checking that the file(s)\nabc added, were copied after the scheduled timings of the workflow\n### Check added files\nsftp get raw files (*.csv.gz) from FTP Server to `/data/1/brond_dsl_stats_LZ`\n```\necho \"ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\" | sftp bigd@999.999.999.999\nsftp> ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150589497 Nov 29 05:34 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.329_2022_11_29.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150823890 Nov 29 13:21 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.330_2022_11_29.csv.gz\n```\nThe second file was indeed added after the scheduled time and has not been picked up by the workflow.\n### Trigger workflow\nYou can now proceed to manually trigger the workflow:\n1. Go to HUE and select \"Jobs\"\n2. Go to \"Workflow\" and select \"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\"\n3. In the next screen, select \"Rerun\"\n4. Wait for the workflow to successfully end\n5.

        "chatbot_answer": " Answer:\n    To manually validate the latest data loaded by the DWHFixed ETL pipeline, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the monitoring app for successful executions: Use the provided `curl` command to query the monitoring API for successful job executions.\n\n2. Check the application logs in Hue: Log in to Hue as the `dwhfixed` user and navigate to the Jobs -> Workflows section to view the workflow execution logs.\n\n3.

The result was an empty export for CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt.\nYesterday's file was zero.\n-1 172.25.37.240 CSI_FIXED CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt 0 1/21/2021 11:00:10 AM 35 1/21/2021 11:00:10 AM CSI_FIXED:CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt:20210121110010035918\n## Actions Taken\n1. Execute steps 1-5 from [this doc](knowledge-base/abc/BigStreamer/20201125-IM1363226.md)\n2. After the check we saw that table `brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist` had no data for 20210119 and 20210120, even though upstream tables were populated.\n```bash\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20210115'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\nResult:\ncount(*)\tpar_dt\t\n...\n2491814\t20210117\t\n2491872\t20210118\t\n2494261\t20210121\t\n...\n```\n3. Check coordinator `coord_brond_load_dsl_daily_stats` that populates this table as explained in [here](systems-info/abc/BigStreamer/Brond/cube_indicators_pipeline.md). \n4. Check that source tables `brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week` and `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week` have data for these partitions. Same query for `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week`\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week\nwhere par_dt >= '20210115'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\nResult:\ncount(*)\tpar_dt\t\n...\n1806006\t20210116\t\n1806256\t20210117\t\n1806306\t20210118\t\n1808049\t20210119\t\n1808918\t20210120\t\n1810234\t20210121\t\n1811401\t20210122\t\n```\nAs source tables have data, we have to execute only the missing inserts for the affected partitions.\n> Since both ADSL and VDSL source tables contained data for `20210119` and `20210120`, the issue is isolated to the execution of the DSL stats coordinator.\n5. Impala insert queries are under `/user/intra/brond_dsl_stats/impala-shell/populate*.sql`. Change conditions `..par_dt > '20210127..` to get the dates that are missing. In this case `20210119`. Execute the queries using Hue or impala-shell.\n6. Repeat step 2 to validate that data are loaded correctly for missing dates.\n7.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\nStep-by-step description of how the ETL pipeline is executed using scripts and Spring Boot app.\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### IPVPN-SM Endpoint: /ingest-query\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`.

It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n# Failure Handling\nHow to debug failed requests, interpret logs, and what to check first when something breaks.\n## Logs\n### Failure Log Locations\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\nWhere to check system health (Grafana, MySQL), common exceptions and their causes, and support scripts.\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Visual Dashboards (Grafana)\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DataBase (MySQL)\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```sql\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```",

You should look for files named like `LM_07_voiceOut_reconciliation.log`.\n```bash\ncat /shared/abc/location_mobility/logging/LM_07_voiceOut_reconciliation.log\n```\nThis log contains information about the date of execution, the name of the file, the export date and the number of lines it contains. You can use this information to verify if the voiceOut export was successful or not.\n```bash\ncat /shared/abc/location_mobility/logging/LM_07_voiceOut_reconciliation.log | grep -i \"exported successfully\"\n```\nIf you find any errors or issues in the log, you can investigate further and take necessary actions to resolve the issue. For example, if you find that the export failed due to a database connection issue, you can check the database connection settings and restart the service if necessary.\n```bash\ncat /shared/abc/location_mobility/logging/LM_07_voiceOut_reconciliation.log | grep -i \"database connection\"\n```\nBy checking the reconciliation log, you can ensure that the voiceOut export was successful and take necessary actions to resolve any issues that may have occurred during the export process.",

Copy the file from a good partition:\n```bash\nhdfs dfs -cp /ez/warehouse/refdata.db/rd_cells_load/par_dt=20201111/cells_20201111.csv /ez/warehouse/refdata.db/rd_cells_load/par_dt=20201110/\n```\n2. Hide the corrupt file:\n```bash\nhdfs dfs -mv /ez/warehouse/refdata.db/rd_cells_load/par_dt=20201110/cells_20201110.csv /ez/warehouse/refdata.db/rd_cells_load/par_dt=20201110/.cells_20201110.csv\n```\n3. Refresh metadata:\n```bash\nimpala-shell -q 'refresh refdata.rd_cells_load;'\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To restore a corrupted partition in the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table, you can follow these steps:\n     1. Check the size of current partition from Impala-Shell using the command: \n```bash\nshow partitions refdata.rd_cells_load;\n```\nThis will help identify if there are any issues with the partition sizes.\n\n2. Inspect the files in the corrupted partition using the command:\n```bash\nshow files in refdata.rd_cells_load partition (par_dt>='20201110');\n```\nThis will provide information about the files in the partition, which can help identify the cause of the corruption.\n\n3. If the issue is due to a missing or corrupted file, you can try copying the file from a previous day's partition or from an external source.\n\n4. Once you have replaced the corrupted file, you can refresh the partition using the command:\n```bash\nrefresh refdata.rd_cells_load;\n```\nThis will update the metadata for the partition and make the new file available for querying.\n\n5. Finally, verify that the partition has been successfully restored by checking the partition size and file list using the commands:\n```bash\nshow partitions refdata.rd_cells_load;\nshow files in refdata.rd_cells_load partition (par_dt>='20201110');\n```\nIf everything looks correct, you can consider the partition restoration complete. \n     By following these steps, you should be able to restore a corrupted partition in the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table.\n```bash\n``` # abc - BigStreamer - IM1353607  - abc BigStreamer (refdata.rd_cells)\n## Description\nPlease load the data for 11/11 and for 10/11\n## Actions Taken\n1.

These actions are handled by different server coordinators of cloudera manager. \nWe checked the log files for each month at the `/shared/abc/refdata/log` path to see which coordinator was responsible for these processes at September 12. After that we logged in Cloudera Manager, and checked the log files at the specific time interval. We found that due to synchronization issues , the coordinator that updated `refdata.rd_cells` updated it before the procedure that refreshed the data at  `refdata.rd_cells_load` so it read the data from the previous date.\nThe solution was to add the parameter **set SYNC_DDL=1** at the necessary scripts so there are no synchronization issues.\nThe logs at cloudera manager are deleted after a certain period of time, so they need to be checked soon after the ticket.\n---\ntitle: Reference Data ETL Flow\nsystem: BigStreamer\ncomponent: Reference Data\njob_name: refdata_etl\nsource_system: Local Filesystem (vantagerd)\nsource_tables:\n  - cells_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz\n  - crm_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz\n  - devices_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz\n  - services_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz\ndestination_system: Hive\ndestination_tables:\n  - refdata.rd_cells_load\n  - refdata.rd_services_load\n  - refdata.rd_crm_load\n  - refdata.rf_devices_load\nschedule: daily at 00:05\ncoordinator: none (cron-based)\nworkflow: 210_refData_Load.sh / 220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh\nscript_path: /shared/abc/refdata/bin\nmonitoring_table: none\nowner: intra\ntags:\n  - Reference Data\n  - refdata\n  - rd_cells_load\n  - rd_crm_load\n  - rd_services_load\n  - rf_devices_load\n  - Hive\n  - Snapshot\n  - Crontab\n  - Bash Scripts\n  - Troubleshooting\n  - Data Validation\n  - Vantagerd\n---\n# Reference Data Flow\nThis document describes the reference data ingestion process for cells, CRM, devices, and services.

Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n## Troubleshooting Steps\nGuidance for identifying if a file has been successfully picked up, processed, and loaded.\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n```bash\n$ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n> -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n$ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n### Possible Response to Ticket\nHow to respond to common tickets from clients regarding missing table updates.\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\n```\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\nCode and documentation related to the pollaploi workflow.\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**\n---\ntitle: osix.sip Ingestion Stopped on 25/11/2020 - Topology and Listener Investigation\ndescription: Resolution steps for halted data ingestion in osix.sip table starting 25/11/2020 07:00, including OSIX-SIP-NORM topology checks, listener health validation, and manual topology resubmission.\ntags:\n  - bigstreamer\n  - abc\n  - osix\n  - osix.sip\n  - data-ingestion\n  - listener\n  - topology\n  - resubmit\n  - kudu\n  - impala\n  - yarn\n  - coord_OsixStreaming_SIP_MonitorResubmit\n  - monitoring\n  - streaming\n  - sip_norm\n  - log-analysis\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  issue_id: IM1367129\n  cluster: abc\n  component: osix.sip\n  affected_node: unosix1\n  ingestion_stopped_at: 2020-11-25 07:00\n  scripts_used:\n    - submit_sip_norm.sh\n  monitoring_tools:\n    - coord_OsixStreaming_SIP_MonitorResubmit\n    - http://172.25.37.251/dashboard/#osix_listeners\n  logs_checked:\n    - /user/osix/resubmit_topology/logs/logs_OSIX-SIP-NORM/date_monitor_sip_norm.log\n  commands_executed:\n    - yarn application -list\n    - impala-shell SELECT par_dt\n  reference_docs:\n    - 18316_abc_Generic_MOP_CDH_5_16_2_Upgrade\n---\n# abc - BigStreamer - IM1367129 - osix.sip 25/11/2020\n## Description\nNo data is being loaded from 25/11/2020 at 07:00 on osix.sip.\n## Actions Taken\n1. ssh unosix1 with your personal account\n2. sudo -iu osix\n3. kinit -kt osix.keytab osix\n4. yarn application -list | grep OSIX-SIP-NORM\n5.

At the YARN UI search for `PRODUSER`, sort by End date and search with \"PROD_IBANK_DWH_EXPORT_ServiceAudit. You will find the failed application.\n4. From the UI we noticed that the job with id application_1651064786946_8294 started manually before the completion of the automated job with id application_1651064786946_8190, which led to the failure of the second job.\n5. We informed the client that they should rerun the failed job manually from the scheduler after the completion of the manual step. Also, we pointed out that before proceding with manual actions they should make sure beforehand that all scheduled flows have completed.\nA review of the application_ids on YARN revealed that application_1651064786946_8294 was launched manually before the completion of the automated scheduled job application_1651064786946_8190, resulting in a resource conflict and batch job failure.\nWe advised the client to avoid overlapping manual executions with scheduler runs to prevent such conflicts in the future.\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster Site IBank Batch\n---\ntitle: AUMS Archive Metadata Table Not Loaded Due to Streamsets Pipeline Stalling\ndescription: Investigation and resolution of missing partitions in the `aums.archive_metadata` table after August 10.

Logged in to Streamsets (https://172.25.37.236:18636/) with `sdc` user and credentials found [here](../../abc-devpasswd.kdbx)\n2. Checked `AUMS Metadata File Feed` pipeline status.

More specifically:\nAfter the **put command at step 3** of the mentioned guide, continue with the following steps below(8-10).\n8. Refreshed table on impala with `refresh aums.archive_metadata` and checked if new partitions were created (impaala queries at step 6). No new partitions had been created.\n9. From Streamsets UI, stop and then start  `AUMS Metadata File Feed` pipeline. If stopping takes too long you can **Force Stop** the pipeline.\n10. Then refresh impala again and ran queries about the days that the data was missing. The queries verified that data had loaded.\n11. Since the pipeline successfully resumed and processed the missing metadata files:\n- remove the <filename>_tmp.csv/zip file from the remfgh sftp directory with the sftp command rm <filename>_tmp.csv/zip. !IMPORTANT\n- clear the local directory from the unnecessary fetched data.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n16/08/23 15:20:30 Europe/Eastern (dsimantirakis):\nThank you.

From the HUE jobs you can see that the workflow (export_Location_Mobility_files_to_mediat...) is killed.\nWe also saw from the logs (lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.20230419.log) that at 15:00 when the problem starts we have the following error:\nQuery submitted at: 2023-04-19 15:00:31 (Coordinator: http://sn72.bigdata.abc.gr:25000)\nQuery progress can be monitored at: http://sn72.bigdata.abc.gr:25000/query_plan?query_id=c74df6d614d535ea:4de432ac00000000\nERROR: Failed due to unreachable impalad(s): sn102.bigdata.abc.gr:22000\nCould not execute command: SELECT\nachievable_thr_bytes_down_1,\nachievable_thr_bytes_up_1,\nachievable_thr_time_down_1,\n..\n[2023/04/19 15:19:13] - ERROR: Impala shell command for par_msisdn= failed.\n[2023/04/19 15:19:13] - ERROR: Clean up and exit.\n% Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current\nFrom there onwards we observe errors of the form:\nQuery submitted at: 2023-04-19 17:00:31 (Coordinator: http://sn64.bigdata.abc.gr:25000)\nQuery progress can be monitored at: http://sn64.bigdata.abc.gr:25000/query_plan?query_id=094fdeda997b8d44:5826172200000000\nERROR: Disk I/O error on sn62.bigdata.abc.gr:22000: Failed to open HDFS file hdfs://nameservice1/ez/warehouse/npce.db/eea_hour/pardt=2023041910/ef4d08b3073e8531-d909e37b0000010\ne_1525512597_data.0.txt\nError(2): No such file or directory\nRoot cause: RemfghException: File does not exist: /ez/warehouse/npce.db/eea_hour/pardt=2023041910/ef4d08b3073e8531-d909e37b0000010e_1525512597_data.0.txt\nat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.INodeFile.valueOf(INodeFile.java:85)\nat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.INodeFile.valueOf(INodeFile.java:75)\nat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSDirStatAndListingOp.getBlockLocations(FSDirStatAndListingOp.java:152)\nat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSNamesystem.getBlockLocations(FSNamesystem.java:1909)\nat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNodeRpcServer.getBlockLocations(NameNodeRpcServer.java:736)\nat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolPB.ClientNamenodeProtocolServerSideTranslatorPB.getBlockLocations(ClientNamenodeProtocolServerSideTranslatorPB.java:415)\nat org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.proto.ClientNamenodeProtocolProtos$ClientNamenodeProtocol$2.callBlockingMethod(ClientNamenodeProtocolProtos.java)\nat org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProtobufRpcEngine$Server$ProtoBufRpcInvoker.call(ProtobufRpcEngine.java:523)\nat org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RPC$Server.call(RPC.java:991)\nat org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$RpcCall.run(Server.java:869)\nWe have similar errors in today's log file lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.20230420.log\n## Root Cause Analysis\nFirst thing that we have checked were the comments on the [md](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/trustcenter_flows.md) that exists for this flow.\nAfter checking the logs of the flow we saw that the flow was running successfully after it had failed for half day. The reason that it was able to run  was the retention that had already taken place the day that we received the ticket.\nWe were able to identify the issue that caused the problem.

Login to `admin.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to root with sudo\n2. Inspect the status of sshd on all nodes\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'grep \"^PermitRootLogin\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config'\n```\n3. Inspect cronjobs of root user on all nodes\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'cronjob -l'\n```\n4. After collecting the scripts executed by root user, we checked the scripts that contain the words `ssh`, `scp` and `rsync`\n```bash\nfor i in {'/root/disk_balance_with_check.sh' '/usr/local/bin/CM_Config_Backup.sh' '/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch_monitoring.sh' '/etc/keepalived/scripts/mysql_check_crontab.sh' '/home/intra/scripts/MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh' '/usr/local/bin/krb5prop.sh' '/root/scripts/ldap_check.sh' '/root/send_haproxy_statistics.sh' '/root/send_haproxy_weekly_statistics.sh' '/home/intra/MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh' '/home/intra/dfs-backup.sh' '/usr/lib/icom/scripts/cdsw_rsync_backup.sh' '/usr/lib/icom/scripts/cdsw_tar_backup.sh' '/home/intra/MySQL_Dump_spec_DB.sh' '/home/intra/scripts/hue_workflows_all.sh' '/root/hive_logs_retention.sh'}\ndo\nsalt \"*\" cmd.run \"if [ -f $i ]; then grep -e ssh -e scp -e rsync $i; fi\" | grep -B1 -e ssh -e scp -e rsync\ndone\n```\n5. Configure ACLs for backup_user. User `backup_user` was created by abc admins to substitute the root login in the scripts above. From the above investigation we determined that `backup_user` needs to be able to login to nodes `un1.bigdata.abc.gr` and `wrkmncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr`\n```bash\n  # un1.bigdata.abc.gr\n  setfacl -R -m d:u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/cmdeploys/\n  setfacl -R -m u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/cmdeploys/\n  setfacl -R -m d:u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/db-backups/db-vip\n  setfacl -R -m u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/db-backups/db-vip\n  setfacl -R -m u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/dfs_backup/\n  setfacl -R -m d:u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/dfs_backup/\n  # Add backup_user to AllowedGroups in /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\n```bash\n  # wrkmncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr\n  setfacl -R -m u:backup_user:rwx /backup\n  setfacl -R -m d:u:backup_user:rwx /backup\n  # Add backup_user to AllowedGroups in /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\n6. Setup SSH Access and Keys. Created `backup user` saltstack state that installs a new private key for passwordless ssh under `/root/backup_user_id/id_backup_user_rsa` on all nodes\n7. Update Cron and Backup Scripts. Change the following scripts to use `backup_user` instead of `root`:\n- /usr/local/bin/CM_Config_Backup.sh\n- /home/intra/scripts/MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh\n- /home/intra/MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh\n- /home/intra/dfs-backup.sh\n- /usr/lib/icom/scripts/cdsw_rsync_backup.sh\n```conf\n# This script uses rsync.

Ensures certificate integrity before replacement.\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command: \n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n### Check signed certificates from mno\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer, subject, TLS Web, date.\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n- Check the issuer\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n- Check the subject\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this:\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n- Check the TLS Web\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n- Check the dates\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n- Or with a for loop for all the files\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder: `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ---\n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\nwith the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nwith the certificate from \n`cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \nand copy the section:\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\nand replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`.\nFor example:\n```bash\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has sent to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same. If not, the certificate is wrong\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\nExplains how to safely stop Spark flows and prepare systems for certificate changes.\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n```\n# Signal Spark flows to shut down safely before cert replacement\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep -i PROD_\n```\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep DEVREST\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\nCovers how to copy, import, and activate the new signed certificates across all cluster nodes.\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\nFrom node01:\n#### Node certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n#### JKS certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\n# Import signed certificate into Cloudera's Java Keystore (JKS) on internal nodes\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```",

It covers kubectl and helm installation, service account creation, role bindings, secrets, and kubeconfig generation\u2014manually or using a plugin.\n## Tools\nThe main tool that needs to be installed is **kubectl**, instructions for which can be found\n[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).\n### Install bash completion for kubectl:\nAdditionally after\ninstallation, completion can be enabled by executing:\n```bash\nmkdir -p /etc/bash_completion.d\nkubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl\n```\nIf possible a nice to have plugin for setting up kubeconfigs can be found at\n[kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin](https://github.com/superbrothers/kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin/releases). Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the [instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing the following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\n### Apply service account and role binding\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\n### Generate user kubeconfig using plugin:\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n---\ntitle: Kubernetes Certificate Renewal Procedure\ndescription: Yearly renewal process for expiring Kubernetes certificates on kubemaster1, kubemaster2, and kubemaster3 including backup, kubeadm certs renewal, and container restarts.\ntags: [kubernetes, certificates, renewal, kubeadm, kubemaster, static pods, downtime, cluster-admin, tls]\ncategory: infrastructure\nproduct: BigStreamer\nplatform: kubernetes\nconfidentiality: internal\n---\n# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring. In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n## Procedure\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n```bash\nsudo su -write the metadata block, tags at the end, tell me what do to clean it and tell me what descriptions to write in order for the document to be properly retrieved in my RAG chatbot\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n```\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n```bash\ncp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n```\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n```bash\nkubeadm  certs renew all\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n```\n- Run the following\n```bash\ncp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\ncp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. Edit the file /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config and replace the values of client-certificate-data and client-key-data with the ones copied from /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf.\nin order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n```bash\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n```bash\nkubectl get pods\n```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\n1bd22e95ef01        5a84bb672db8           \"kube-scheduler --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-scheduler_kube-scheduler-cti-cx1_kube-system_649aa160f1bd0840b2bb0f70b6493f99_9\ncf43799ae77d0       b6e18ffb844e6          \"kube-apiserver --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                 \n```\nStop containers IDs:\n```bash\nctrctl stop 1350c48cbfb5 1bd22e95ef01 cf3cb7655b99d\n```\n> Ndef_1: Keep in mind that when the containers will be stopped, there will be downtime\n> Ndef_2: Keep in mind that those pods are static so you don't need to kill them. They will be automatically restarted\n- Also delete core-dns pod:\n```bash\nkubectl get pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns\nNAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\ncoredns-64897985d-7dzkl   1/1     Running   3 (84d ago)   644d\ncoredns-64897985d-rw5kc   1/1     Running   0             83d\n```\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-64897985d-7dzkl  coredns-64897985d-rw5kc  -n kube-system\n```\n- Repeat the same procedure for `kubemaster2` and `kubemaster3`\n> Note: The user `incelligent` exists only on kubemaster1.

Log events showed repeated errors related to mounting the `logs` volume, with specific references to device formatting failures (e.g., `mke2fs exit status 1`) and timeouts in the Kubernetes event log.\nDespite restarting the pod, it remained in an `Init:0/1` state. Investigations using `kubectl`, Longhorn UI, and `kubemaster` logs revealed that three PVC replicas were stuck in a deleting state, which blocked the volume from attaching correctly. This indicated a storage issue potentially linked to a bug in the Longhorn engine.\nThe airflow scheduler is down due to access rights in the logs folder.\npod airflow-scheduler-0 had entered a restart loop as shown below.\n```bash\nroot@kubemaster1:~# kubectl get pods -n ranai-geo\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nairflow-postgresql-0 1/1 Running 0 326d\nairflow-scheduler-0 0/2

investigate possible underlying storage issues, we accessed [Longhorn](https://kubemaster-vip.bigdata.abc.gr/longhorn/) and discovered that the PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) associated with the airflow-scheduler had three replicas of airflow-scheduler pvc stuck in a deleting state.\n![longhornUI](.media/longhornbug.JPG)\n## Resolution\nTo resolve the issue and restore the airflow-scheduler pod's functionality, the following steps were taken:\n### Deletion of Problematic PVC\nThe three problematic replicas of airflow-scheduler PVC in Longhorn, which were stuck in a deleting state, were the problem, as a result we deleted the airflow's PVC.\nNfgh: It is important to mention that this issue might be related to a bug within the Longhorn storage system, as it caused replicated PVCs to get stuck in a deleting state. Further investigation and monitoring of Longhorn may be necessary to prevent such issues from recurring.

We also noticed problems with geolocation streams and loc mob files.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Connect with personal creds `https://172.25.37.232:7183` Cloudera Manager\n2. Both Namenodes entered standby mode simultaneously which caused bad health on HDFS,HBASE,OOZIE,IMPALA. After nn1 restarted nn2 became the Active and nn1 the Standby namenode. All the other services was stable after this manual action except HBASE which restarted.\n> The dual-standby state of both Namenodes caused a loss of HDFS coordination, which cascaded failures to other dependent services like HBase, Oozie, and Impala. After restarting nn1, high availability was restored with nn2 becoming active.\n3. Since all services were stable check HUE `https://172.25.37.236:8888/oozie/list_oozie_workflows/` to ensure that all workflows running.\n4.

The crash was caused by an `OutOfMemoryError`, due to the default Java heap size being set too low (512MB).\nThe following health issue has occurred in the cloudera manager system:\n```\nSpark on yarn - History Server (dr1node03) - Unexpected Exits\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for DR Site\n2. We inspected logs for this role for the time that the problem arose: `Cloudera > Diagnostics > Logs` and chose `Service: Spark on Yarn` and `Role: History Server`. We could not identify the root cause by these logs\n3. ssh to dr1node03 as root, went to `/var/run/process` , and inspected logs from the process that ran at the time of the problem and found out that the process with pid 51291 was killed while a `OutOfMemoryError` occured\n![terminal_screenshot](.media/IM2098517/spark_on_yarn.png)\n### Resolution\n4. We checked the  `java heap size` of the History Server through Cloudera UI configuration tab. It was set to 512M.\n5. We checked the respective option for the PR Site and it was set to 2G\n6. We set the `java heap size` of the History Server to 2G at the DR Site\n7. We proceeded to restart of the role after communication with the customer\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n07/03/23 16:28:55 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nWe have restarted the History Server after a phone call. There was no problem during the restart.\nThank you\n07/03/23 16:21:21 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe exit occurred due to an out of memory error. We have changed the java heap size of the History Server from 512MB to 2GB as in the PR. We will need to restart the role. There will be no outage.\n```\n---\ntitle: Oracle Java 1.8 Minor Upgrade on Edge Nodes\ndescription: Procedure for upgrading Oracle Java 1.8 to a newer minor version on BigStreamer edge nodes, including local RPM repository setup, edge node preparation, execution, certificate handling, update-alternatives configuration, and rollback instructions.\ntags:\n  - java\n  - oracle-java\n  - upgrade\n  - edge-nodes\n  - yum\n  - rpm\n  - certificates\n  - update-alternatives\n  - rollback\n  - cloudera\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  systems:\n    - pr1edge01\n    - pr1edge02\n    - dr1edge01\n    - dr1edge02\n    - pr1node01\n  tools:\n    - Oracle Java 8\n    - YUM\n    - update-alternatives\n    - Wildfly\n    - jssecacerts\n  repositories:\n    - /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n---\n# Oracle Java 1.8 Upgrade Procedure on Edge Nodes\nThis document describes the controlled upgrade of Oracle Java 1.8 minor versions on BigStreamer edge nodes. It covers the creation and maintenance of a local RPM repository on pr1node01, edge node backup and update procedures, handling of security certificates, switching Java versions using update-alternatives, and guidance for validating application behavior post-upgrade. Rollback steps are also provided.\nThis document outlines the upgrade process of minor java version for Oracle Java 1.8\non mno's edge nodes. All procedures pertain to PR and DR edge nodes, except the RPM repository\ncreation which is performed on pr1node1:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n## Step 1: Create Local RPM Repository\nThis step only needs to be performed once as all subsequent RPM's will be placed inside this\nrepository. SSH into **p1node01** and as root create the repository directories:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# mkdir -p /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n```\nDownload the desired RPMs from [Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html), place them inside\n`/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` and create the repository:\n```bash\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo .\n```\nSSH into one of the edge nodes, create the corresponding yum repo file and **scp** it into\nall other edge nodes:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxx@pr1edge01\n$ sudo -i\n# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo\n[oracle_java]\nname = oracle_java\nbaseurl =  http://p1node01.mno.gr/oracle_java\nenabled = 1\ngpgcheck = 0\n# scp /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo XXXedgeXX:/etc/yum.repos.d/\n```\nFinally on each edge node install the above packages:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum install jdk-1.8\n```\n## Step 2: Update the Repository with New RPMs\nDownload the desired version of Oracle Java 8 from\n[Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) or\n[Oracle Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and\nplace the RPMs inside `/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` of **pr1node01**. Login to\n**pr1node01** and update the repository with the new packages:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo --update .\n```\n## Step 3: Upgrade Java on Edge Hosts\n### Preparation\nBefore upgrading the edge nodes, their resources must be moved to other nodes and a backup\nof the old java be made. Login to each edge node:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# cp -rap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64/  /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n### Execution\nInside each edge node, update the java package using **YUM**:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum update java-1.8\n```\nCopy the old certificates into the new installation directory and run the update alternatives\ntool where you input the new version when prompted:\n```bash\n# cp -ap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts \\\n/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<new version>-amd64/jre/lib/security/\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\nIf everything is OK unstandby the node and check each wildfly instance's access and\nserver logs for the following:\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/server.log`: There are no undeployed WARs\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/access.log`: Everything is reporting HTTP 200 status\nDetailed wildfly information and management instructions can be found\n[here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/manage_wildfly.md).\n## Step 4: Rollback to Previous Java Version\nLogin to each edge node and downgrade using the update-alternatives and inputting the previous version:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```",

Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox\n2. At the YARN UI search for `PRODREST` and sort by End date. You will find the failed application.\n3. From the UI we saw that Spark exited due to OOM errors.\n4. Using this [document](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch) we executed Merge Batch in 3 steps in parallel:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 00:00:00\" \"2022-02-28 12:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 12:00:00\" \"2022-02-28 18:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 18:00:00\" \"2022-01-03 00:00:00\"\n```\n5. We updated the monitoring postgres database in order for the entry to appear green in Grafana. You can get a success query for Merge batch from the log file of the master script and change the dates. To confirm resolution, verify that Grafana shows no failed MergeBatch jobs for 2022-02-28.\n6. We created a copy of the master script as `PRODREST` at `dr1edge01`.\n7. nside the copied script, we removed the pre-processing steps before the [Distinct join to Service Audit](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#distinct-join-to-service-audit) stage.\n8.

The main output is the `brond.cube_indicators` table, populated for `par_date = today - 2 days`.\n* Coordinator `1011_Fixed_brond_customers`  populates table `brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily`\n* Coordinator `Coord_post_BROND_FIXED_CUSTOMERS` populates tables `brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq` & `brond.fixed_customers_brond_latest`\n* Coordinator `Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators` for `par_date=date -2 days` populates table `brond.cube_indicators`  and its dependencies are:\n  * `brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp` populated by script `un2:/shared/abc/brond/bin/101_fixed_radius.sh`\n  * `brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq`\n  * `radius.radacct_hist` populated by script `un2:/shared/abc/radius/DataParser/scripts/radius.pl`\n  * `brond.brond_retrains_hist` populated by script `un2:/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/brond_retrains.pl`\n  * `brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist` populated by Coordinator `coord_brond_load_dsl_daily_stats`\n---\ntags:\n  - cube_indicators\n  - brond\n  - coordinator\n  - radius\n  - retrains\n  - fixed_customers\n  - xdsl\n  - spark\n  - hadoop\n  - data_dependencies\n---\n---\ntitle: CSI_fix Export Empty Due to Missing Partitions in brond.cube_indicators\ndescription: Investigation and resolution of missing CSI_fix export files caused by absent data in brond.cube_indicators for 20201120\u201320201122; includes dependent table validation, coordinator rerun, and manual export execution.\ntags:\n  - bigstreamer\n  - abc\n  - hive\n  - impala\n  - hue\n  - workflow\n  - coordinator\n  - csi_fix\n  - brond.cube_indicators\n  - par_dt\n  - partition-missing\n  - export-failure\n  - cube_indicators\n  - cube_indicators_it\n  - sai.fix\n  - spark\n  - impala-shell\n  - mtuser\n  - sequential-export\n  - delayed-export\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  cluster: abc\n  issue_id: IM1363226\n  user: mtuser\n  export_script: /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh\n  logs:\n    - sai_csi.cron.YYYYMMDD.log\n    - CSI_fix_reconciliation.log\n  views_and_tables:\n    - sai.cube_indicators_it (view)\n    - brond.cube_indicators (base)\n    - brond.brond_retrains_hist\n    - brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp\n    - brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq\n    - radius.radacct_hist\n    - brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\n  missing_partitions:\n    - 20201120\n    - 20201121\n    - 20201122\n  tools:\n    - impala-shell\n    - Hue\n    - Cloudera Manager\n    - bash\n    - cron\n---\n# abc - BigStreamer - IM1363226 - abc BigStreamer csi_fixed coollection issue\n## Description\n CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt was exported empty\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `mtuser` with sudo\n2. Inspect logs of *CSI fix* flow. Nfgh that filename format is `CSI_fix_<mmddyyyy>_w<week>.txt` and that there is a 2 day delay between the export time and the exported data. In this case there was a problem with the file containing data for 2020-11-22 which was exported at 2020-11-24. So we checked the logs for 2020-11-24. \n```bash\ncd /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log\nless sai_csi.cron.20201124.log\n```\n3. Check if the source table contained data for the export date.\nIn `sai_csi.cron.20201124.log`:\n``` bash\nQuery: use `sai`\nQuery: select nvl ... from sai.cube_indicators_it where par_dt='20201122'\n...\nFetched 0 row(s) in 0.06s\nProblem with 20201122.\n```\n4. Check if the source table contains data for this date. Please nfgh that the source table is just a view of table `brond.cube_indicators`.\n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2458393,20201123\n```\n5. Identify Missing Data in brond.cube_indicators. Since 3 dates are missing 2020/11/20-22, we need to run the workflow that populates `brond.cube_indicators`. But first we have to make sure all its table dependecies are loaded. Execute the following queries in an impala-shell or an Impala editor in Hue and make sure not only that partitions exist for those dates but also that there are an identical amount of lines.\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_retrains_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20201118'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\n...\ncount(*),par_dt\n2499833,20201118\n2497948,20201119\n*2496522,20201120*\n*2497810,20201121*\n*2497480,20201122*\n2496932,20201123\n2497130,20201124\n2505791,20201125\n``` \nExecute the same query for tables:\n- brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp\n- brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq\n- radius.radacct_hist\n- brond.brond_retrains_hist\n- brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nThis confirms the root cause: the brond.cube_indicators table lacked data for these dates, resulting in empty CSI_fix exports.\n6. Rerun Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators for Missing Partitions. Run Cube_Indicators workflow. Login to Hue as intra and navigate to Workflows > Dashboards > Coordinators. Search for `Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators` and click on the coordinator to view its executions. Select **one** at a time of the executions that need to be repeated. Nfgh that `brond.cube_indicators` is populated with a 2 day delay so if we want to load data for 2020-11-20 we have to execute the workflow of 2020-11-22. Select the execution from the check box and click `Rerun`. \n7. After each workflow execution repeat the query of step 4 to verify that table has been loaded. \n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2454321,20201120\n2458393,20201123\n```\n8. Gather dates that need to be exported. As we saw in step 5 the source table was empty for 3 partitions: 20201120, 20201121, 20201122. The files produced for them was empty. Verify by checking `/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log`:\n```bash\n2020-11-21 09:01:39  CSI_fix_11212020_w47.txt  20201119  2453089\n2020-11-22 09:00:43  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  0\n2020-11-23 09:28:14  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  0\n2020-11-24 09:01:01  CSI_fix_11242020_w47.txt  20201122  0\n2020-11-25 09:03:13  CSI_fix_11252020_w48.txt  20201123  2458393\n```\n*CSI fix* provides a mechanism to avoid manual re-export of empty files. The most recent date of an empty file is stored in a table and automatically exported with the next execution. To view the date stored issue the query:\n```bash\nselect * from refdata.mediation_csi_load_info;\n...\nload_time,flow_name\nNULL,sai.mob\n20201122,sai.fix\n```\nSo we don't need to export manually date 20201122, only dates 20201120 & 20201121.\n9. Manually Export CSI_fix Files Using export_csi_fix.sh. Finally, to export the files we have to repeat step 1 and execute the export script **sequentially** for the desired dates + 2 days:\n```bash\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201122 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201123 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n```\nThis confirms the missing CSI_fix files were regenerated successfully with the expected number of lines.\n10. Afterwards check the reconciliation log file that files have been exported:\n```bash\nless /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log\n...\n2020-11-25 10:46:40  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  4915294\n2020-11-25 10:51:17  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  2457858\n```\nThe first one contains more lines as it includes dates 20201120 & 20201122.\n## Affected Systems\nabc Bigstreamer Backend\n---\ntitle: \"Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\"\ndescription: \"Instructions for manually executing the Cube Indicators Spark job from terminal on un1.bigdata.abc.gr, including how to pull the latest script, modify execution date, and run the submit script.\"\ntags:\n  - cube indicators\n  - spark job\n  - pyspark\n  - hdfs\n  - brond\n  - manual execution\n  - terminal\n  - big data\n  - intra\n---\n# Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\nThis guide explains how to manually run the Cube Indicators Spark job for missing dates from the terminal.

The issue affects both historical and streaming tables, with warnings appearing due to out-of-date or missing metadata. It includes steps for HDFS size verification, reviewing Impala table stats, running `compute stats`, and `refresh`, as well as caveats for high-frequency streaming tables like `sai.sms_raw`.\nThe following tables have potentially corrupt table statistics. Drop and re-compute statistics to resolve this problem. ->\nsai.voice_quality_hist,\nsai.sms_raw, \nsai.voice_raw,\nbrond.brond_retrains_hist,\nbrond.td_dslam_week,\nookla.ookla_android,\nookla.ookla_ios,\nookla.ookla_stnet,\ntemip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms,\ntemip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms\n## Actions Taken\nTables like sai.sms_raw ingest data every 5 minutes, which makes real-time statistics invalid or misleading.\n### HDFS Table Size Check\nRun the following commands on un2 as user `intra` to inspect HDFS directory sizes of the affected tables:\n```bash\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/sai.db/voice_quality_hist\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/brond.db/brond_retrains_hist\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/brond.db/td_dslam_week\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_android\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_ios\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_stnet\n``` \n### Check Impala Table Stats\nReview current statistics for the affected tables via the Impala shell:\n```bash\nshow table stats  sai.voice_quality_hist               ;\nshow table stats  sai.sms_raw                          ;\nshow table stats  sai.voice_raw                        ;\nshow table stats  brond.brond_retrains_hist            ;\nshow table stats  brond.td_dslam_week                  ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_android                  ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_ios                      ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_stnet                    ;\nshow table stats  temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms ;\nshow table stats  temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms   ;\n```\n### Recompute Statistics",

For example, it mentions that `101_fixed_radius.sh` is used to populate `brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp`.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection and comparison with the reference answer, there are some minor discrepancies and omissions in the chatbot's response.\n\nFor instance, while the chatbot correctly identifies many of the dependency tables and their corresponding population scripts, it does not explicitly mention every single table or script listed in the reference answer. This omission might be considered a minor error, depending on how strictly one interprets the requirement for completeness.\n\nAnother potential issue with the chatbot's response is that it does not provide a clear, concise summary of the key points at the beginning or end of its response. While the information is generally well-organized and easy to follow, the lack of a brief overview might make it slightly more difficult for readers to quickly grasp the main ideas being presented.\n\nIn conclusion, while the chatbot's response is generally accurate and comprehensive, there are some minor errors and omissions that prevent it from being considered perfect.

The main issue was that the provided keytab used deprecated `arc4-hmac` encryption, and the OS defaulted to using an incompatible KCM ticket cache. This blocked application authentication with error messages indicating missing keys. The problem was resolved by forcing a file-based ticket cache, removing the `sssd-kcm` service, and enabling support for weak crypto in `/etc/krb5.conf`.\n```\n/way4/DEVUSER.keytab does not contain any keys for DEVUSER@BANK.CENTRAL.mno.GR\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. The new server hosting the application is RHEL 8 instead of Solaris. We tried to manually `kinit`\nFrom the server with `way4`:\n``` bash\nkinit DEVUSER@BANK.CENTRAL.mno.GR -kt /way4/DEVUSER.keytab\n```\nOutput:\n```bash\nTicket cache: KCM:1500\nDefault principal: DEVUSER@BANK.CENTRAL.mno.GR\nValid starting       Expires              Service principal\n15/03/2023 12:35:29  16/03/2023 12:35:29  krbtgt/BANK.CENTRAL.mno.GR@BANK.CENTRAL.mno.GR\nrenew until 22/03/2023 12:35:29\n```\n2. **Anything** but `FILE` ticket caches is sure to create a problem.\nFrom the server with `root`:\n``` bash\nvi /etc/krb5.conf\n```\nChange the following under `libdefaults` section:\n``` conf\ndefault_ccache_name = FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_%{uid}\n```\nAlso, remove `sssd-kcm`:\n```bash\nyum remove sssd-kcm\n```\n3. After that the klist output used a `FILE` cache, but the problem persisted.\nSince the OS problems were resolved we focused the keytab.\nFrom the server with `way4`\n``` bash\nklist -kte /way4/DEVUSER.keytab\n```\nOutput:\n```\nKeytab name: FILE:/way4/DEVUSER.keytab\nKVNO Timestamp           Principal\n---- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  0 01/01/1970 00:00:00 DEVUSER@BANK.CENTRAL.mno.GR (DEPRECATED:arc4-hmac) \n```\nThat DEPRECATED flag is not a good sign. \n4.

It also includes detailed troubleshooting steps for resolving SPN-related Kerberos preauthentication errors and replication failures across KDCs.\n# Manage IDM Replication\n## Setup\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been installed on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n### Force replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n## Troubleshooting\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n### A brief history of preauthentication\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### Troubleshooting Preauthentication Issues\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n```bash\nipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n```\n```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n```\n```bash\nipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n```\n```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR",

This morning we reset the user's password because it had expired. It can connect normally with the credentials. Also let me know that the applications of the other users (Charisis, Ploskas) are running normally.\n## Actions Taken\n### 1. Validate LDAP Bind Account (t1-svc-cnebind)\n- Ssh to **unrstudio1**\n- Do an ldap search using `t1-svc-cnebind` as the following in order to check if `t1-svc-cnebind` password is still valid:\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=t1-svc-cnebind)'\n```\n-  In the above case, if you get an error that you can't connect with the ldap server, that means it has an expired `t1-svc-cnebind` password, so you will need to replace it with a new one.\n### 2. Update LDAP Bind Password in RStudio Connect Config\n- Check the configuration file below for the current ldap t1-svc-cnebind password & replace it with new **(Responsible for that abc Admin)**:\n```bash\nssh unrstudio1\nvi /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg\n```\n### Conclusion\nRStudio Connect applications for user `kmpoletis` failed due to expired `t1-svc-cnebind` LDAP credentials.

In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\nOutput must be something like below:\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no output.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nTransfer user ownership and projects from central-domain to GROUPNET in case of duplicated accounts\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- Chrisostomos Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- Chrisostomos Charisis, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n---\ntitle: \"Fixing OpenLDAP Replication Issues\"\ndescription: \"Step-by-step instructions for resolving OpenLDAP replication failures between kerb1 and kerb2, including password updates, slapcat/slapadd procedures, and verification via ldapsearch.\"\ntags:\n  - openldap\n  - replication\n  - ldap\n  - slapcat\n  - slapadd\n  - kerb1\n  - kerb2\n  - phpldapadmin\n  - ldapsearch\n  - slapd\n  - sync\n  - mirror mode\n  - user creation\n  - credentials\n  - config.ldif\n  - data.ldif\n  - restore ldap\n  - slapd.d\n---\n# How to fix openldap replication\nThis guide documents how to fix broken OpenLDAP replication between kerb1 and kerb2, addressing two scenarios: a Manager password change or corruption due to events like power outages.

The procedure involves log review on the ingestion and source systems (un2 and nnmprd01) and CSV generation verification.\n# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n- Connect to `un2` as `ipvpn` and inspect the log file:\n```bash\nssh root@un2\nsu ipvpn\ntail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n```\n- The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n- Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n```bash\nssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n```\n- Review the transfer log:\n```ssh\ntail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n```\nThe last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nRoot Cause: No Interface Metrics files were generated by NNM between `14:30` and `14:50`, explaining the IF alerts.\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n- Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n```bash\ntail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n```\nThe last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nRoot Cause: No CPU/MEM files were generated by NNM between `14:30` and `15:00`, explaining the CPU/MEM alerts.\n---\ntitle: [PR][IBANK] Query Average Response Time Alert on Grafana\ndescription: Investigation of Grafana alert \"[PR][IBANK] Query Average Response Time\" caused by a few high-latency queries due to user activity.

To reduce the times we need to investigate if the schema of bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist can be improved, if we can delete the `REFRESH nnmnps.nms_node ...` queries etc. This should be analyzed further (see Action Point 2) to determine if schema optimization or query logic simplification can reduce query execution time. Nfghs as Action Point 2.\n## Affected Systems\nabc Bigstreamer Backend\n## Action Points\n1. Investigate empty response of Impala query for 13:05 even after refreshing the table\n2.

We proposed to the client to remove the two hosts from the logical cluster, since they did not have any roles.\n```\nFrom Cloudera Manager\nHosts > All Hosts > Check `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` and `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` > Actions > Remove from Cluster\n```\n```bash\nsystemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent\n```\n6.

While these sections may offer valuable insights and practical advice for resolving specific issues, they do not necessarily contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the core topic at hand.\n\nIn light of these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that while the chatbot response does provide some useful information and guidance on managing IDM replication, its overall effectiveness and clarity are somewhat compromised by the inclusion of excessive and tangential details.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 4**\n\nThe provided response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides relevant information. However, it could be improved by being more concise and focused on the essential aspects of managing IDM replication. \n\nNote that this score is based on the evaluation criteria provided, which

The crash was caused by an `OutOfMemoryError`, due to the default Java heap size being set too low (512MB).\nThe following health issue has occurred in the cloudera manager system:\n```\nSpark on yarn - History Server (dr1node03) - Unexpected Exits\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for DR Site\n2. We inspected logs for this role for the time that the problem arose: `Cloudera > Diagnostics > Logs` and chose `Service: Spark on Yarn` and `Role: History Server`. We could not identify the root cause by these logs\n3. ssh to dr1node03 as root, went to `/var/run/process` , and inspected logs from the process that ran at the time of the problem and found out that the process with pid 51291 was killed while a `OutOfMemoryError` occured\n![terminal_screenshot](.media/IM2098517/spark_on_yarn.png)\n### Resolution\n4. We checked the  `java heap size` of the History Server through Cloudera UI configuration tab. It was set to 512M.\n5. We checked the respective option for the PR Site and it was set to 2G\n6. We set the `java heap size` of the History Server to 2G at the DR Site\n7. We proceeded to restart of the role after communication with the customer\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n07/03/23 16:28:55 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nWe have restarted the History Server after a phone call.

Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account and then to `dr1node01.mno.gr`\n2. Move to the process folder:\n```bash\ncd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/\n```\n3. Find the latest process and go to that folder. In our case is 12200-kudu-KUDU_TSERVER. So move to that folder:\n```bash\ncd 12200-kudu-KUDU_TSERVER\n```\n4. Use the keytab you just found in that folder:\n```bash\nkinit -kt kudu.keytab kudu/`hostname`\n```\n5. Check kudu cluster health and specifically for `prod_trlog_card_analytical` database in order to check if the wanted table is created.\n```bash\nkudu cluster ksck dr1node04.mno.gr dr1node05.mno.gr dr1node06.mno.gr | grep -i prod_trlog_card_analytical\n```\nAs you can see the `prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp` table is not created.\n**Optional**: You can also verify that from impala-shell running the following commands:\n- Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account\n- impala-shell -i dr1edge01 -k --ssl\n- `[dr1edge01.mno.gr:21000] default> use prod_trlog_card_analytical;`\n- `[dr1edge01.mno.gr:21000] default> show tables;`\nAs you can see the `prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp` table is not created.\n6. Login to CM DR with your pesonal account > Go to impala > Queries\n7. In the search bar type the following in order to find the query:\n`STATEMENT RLIKE '.*prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp'.*` and click on the query details for investigation.\nWe found that the query they try to run is the following:\n```bash\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS prod_trog_card analytical.opticash ispencing_atm_tmp\ncashp id, STRING NOT NULL\n, transaction date STRING NOT NULL\n,denom id STRING\n, cassette STRING\n, crncy id STRING\n, open Bal BIGINT\n, norm del BIGINT\n, norm rtr BIGINT\n, unpl_ del BIGINT\n, unpl_tr BIGINT\n, wthdrwls BIGINT\n, pre_wdrw BIGINT\n, deposits BIGINT\n, clos_bal BIGINT\n, bal_disp BIGINT\n, bal_escr BIGINT\n, bal_unav BIGINT\n, opr_stat STRING\n, excld_fl STRING\n\u201aPRIMARY KEY (cashp_id, transaction date, denom_id, cassette)\n) STORED AS KUDU\n```\nWe try to rerun the above query and we get the following error:\n```bash\nERROR: ImpalaRuntimeException: Error creating Kudu table 'prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp'\nCAUSED BY: NonRecoverableException: failed to wait for Hive Metastore notification log listener to catch up: failed to retrieve notification log events: failed to get Hive Metastore next notification: Thrift SASL frame is too long: 338.01M/100.00M\n```\n### Resolution\nAs a first step, let's try to fix `Thrift SASL frame is too long: 338.01M/100.00M` error.\n1. Login to Cloudera Manager in DR site with your personal administrative account:\n`Kudu > Instances > Click on Master > Select Tab Configuration`\n2. In `Search` box write safety valvue and at `Master Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve for gflagfile)` add th following flag:\n```bash\n--hive_metastore_max_message_size_bytes=858993459\n```\n>**Important Ndef**:  The above step with flag must be set at all three masters\n3. Restart the three kudu masters (one at a time)\n4. After rerunning the query the table is not still created but this time we get the following error: \n```bash\nSASL decode failed: SASL(-1): generic failure:\nwO706 15:44:11.242372 109675 hms_notification_log_listener.cc:130] Hive Metastore notification log listener poll failed: Not authorized: failed to ret\nrieve notification log events: failed to get Hive Metastore next notification: SASL decode failed: SASL(-1): generie failure:\nw0706 15:44:35.127687 109673 hms_client.cc:345] Time spent get HMS notification events: real 8.885s user 0.000s sys 0.228s\n```\n5. Restarting all Tablet Servers (dr1node01-10),one at a time, fixed the problem. \n**Before Restarting Tablets the following Flows must be stopped !!!**\n```\nPROD_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible\nPROD_Online_IngestStream\nPROD_IBank_IngestStream\n```\nStop the flows:\n>Ndef: We used following command because flows were working fine. Otherwise, we you should kill the application.\n```bash\nhdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\nhdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown _marker/\nhdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nWhen Tablets are all up and running make sure you start again the flows. \nVerify that Tablets and Kudu is up and running by checking graphs and CM UI (CM -> Kudu -> Charts Library)\nInformation about how to start flows can be found [here](http://https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/tree/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows \"here\")\nWe verified that the problem is fixed by running the querry and got Table has been created message.\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThis problem occurred due to dr1node07 disk replacement.\nPlease refer to *IM1893876* for more information.",

The failure occurred during the `JOB` component execution and was traced to Impala resource exhaustion caused by HBase write quotas and high data volume at end-of-month.\nThe following failed batch job appeared in the Grafana system:\n```\napplication :  IBank_Ingestion\njob_name : MergeBatch\ncomponent : JOB\ndate : 28-02-2023\nstatus : FAILED\ndescription :\nhost : pr1edge01.mno.gr\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. We identified the failed step using the alarm name. Steps `MSSQL Sqoop Import (Migration)` and `Insert to Service Audit` had been executed successfully. We rerun the `Merge Batch` according to [this](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch).\n2. The job had not completed at approximately 9.pm on 01/03/2023 we terminated the job after communication with the customer in order for the night flow to run without any problems. We scheduled to rerun the job in the following day after the completion of the daily MergeBatch.\n3.

The `Upsert to HBase` stage that synchronises the `Visible` table caused an Impala problem during which Impala stopped to process this job as well as other requests.\n5. The problem is described below.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG.

On logging into Cloudera Manager, all services were marked red. Some dependent applications had crashed due to this. Some of the applications crashed as well.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to grafana to make sure that the alert is about DR SITE. We noticed that there were alerts for IBANK Spark Waiting Batches but not for Visible which predisposes us for an issue with Kudu.\n![ibank_kudu_problem](.media/SD1949713/ibank_kudu_problem.PNG)\n2. Login to Cloudera UI for the DR Site.\n3. From `Charts>Impala Perf` we noticed increased resource commitment through Impala Pool Reserved and Threads charts.\n![Impala Pool Reserved](.media/Impala_pool_reserved.PNG)\n![Threads](.media/threads.PNG)\n4. From `Cloudera Manager>Impala>Queries` we searched for queries that took place at the time the problem raised. We found that the query with ID 6d44d9525a681fb8:5e536ffc00000000 had Threads:CPU Time 10.7h. Upon inspection through `Query Details` we saw that the query was of high complexity with conversions and comparisons with regex.\n![Query](.media/query.PNG)\n5. Through Cloudera logs, we noticed that the query impacted the services in the form of timeouts for Kudu and Hive due to slow communication with Sentry Service.\n![hive_problem](.media/SD1949713/hive_problem.PNG)\n![timeouts_kudu](.media/SD1949713/timeouts_kudu.PNG)\n![sentry_problem](.media/SD1949713/sentry_problem.PNG)\n6. The issue resolved itself once the query completed execution and the resource usage dropped. No manual recovery steps were required. We informed the client that it was due to a high complexity query ran by a normal user that resulted in an increased undertaking of resources.\n## Affected Systems\nDR Site\n---\ntitle: IBank_Migration Job Failure - Enrich SA from SA_old (Memory Limit Exceeded)\ndescription: The 'Enrich SA from SA_old' batch job on 30-03-2023 failed due to Impala memory exhaustion during execution on pr1node05; rerun manually after verifying service_audit partition and updating Grafana monitoring DB.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - ibank\n  - service_audit\n  - impala\n  - memory limit exceeded\n  - grafana\n  - enrichment\n  - upsert to hbase\n  - duplicates\n  - kudu\n  - hbase\n  - impala query failure\n  - retry job\n  - monitoring update\n  - prodrest\n  - im2180781\n  - pr1edge01\n  - date_20230330\n  - manual rerun\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: SD2180781\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: Impala memory limit exceeded on pr1node05 during join query for service_audit enrichment\n  resolution_summary: Reran enrichment script after verifying missing par_dt=20230330, then manually updated monitoring DB and ran HBase upsert and duplication report scripts\n  related_scripts:\n    - ibank_service_audit_insert_join_distinct.sh\n    - ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh\n    - report_duplicates_kudu_hbase_impala_STABLE.sh\n  related_tables:\n    - prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit\n    - prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream\n    - prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old\n  monitoring_updated: true\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - SD2180781 - Failed job at Grafana \n## Description\nOn 30-03-2023, the \"Enrich SA from SA_old\" job failed due to an Impala memory allocation error on pr1node05.\nThe following failed job appeared in Grafana:\n```\nApplication: IBank_Migration\nJob_name: Enrich SA from SA_old\nComponment: JOB\nDate: 30-03-2023\nStatus: FAILED\nHost: pr1edge01.mno.gr\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1.

Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account and confirm that Datawarehouse Flows have failed from `Monitoring/Monitoring PR/DR` dashboard.\n2. All flows have failed with `Code: 6` which means that the control script has timed-out while monitoring the `EXTRACT` script. The `EXTRACT` step has 2 sub-steps: `Impala Insert` and `Sqoop Export`.\n3. Check logs:\nFrom `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:\n``` bash\nless /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log\n```\nIn this file for all flows that failed we see that the last log entry is the submission of the `Impala Insert` part of the `EXTRACT`, which was still running. This means that another query is hogging all resources for Impala and our flows are waiting to be executed.\n4. Login to Disaster Site Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.mno.gr:7183` and check for resource intensive Impala queries `Clusters > Impala > Queries`. The key resource here is memory as this is the only metric that can be defined in Resource Pools.\nThe query that created the problem was `COMPUTE STATS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`. Pictures are not included because Impala does not report statistics for the `COMPUTE STATS` queries, but given the size of the table and the time of execution it matched. This hypothesis was later confirmed when the same problem appeared on a later `COMPUTE STATS` execution.\n5. We informed the customer to re-run the failed jobs and proposed to stop computing statistics for that table as they did not impact our application.\n``` text\n27/10/22 13:16:01 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nPlease rerun the flow steps that encountered a problem.\nWe are continuing to investigate the root cause of the problem.\n**Workaround**\n27/10/22 13:32:44 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nFollowing the previous answer, the compute statistics on the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table committed many resources on the Calatog Server and the query Coordinator (dr1node02), resulting in REFRESH/INVALIDATE METADATA operations experiencing long execution times and causing jobs to time out. After the compute statistics were completed, Impala released the resources and resumed.\nAs we have communicated in the past, from our perspective the statistics of the table are not necessary. Please let us know if we can disable the production of statistics for this particular table.\n**Resolved**\n```\n6.

Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account and confirm that Datawarehouse Flows have failed from `Monitoring/Monitoring PR/DR` dashboard.\n2. All flows have failed with `Code: 6` which means that the control script has timed-out while monitoring the `EXTRACT` script. The `EXTRACT` step has 2 sub-steps: `Impala Insert` and `Sqoop Export`.\n3. Check logs:\nFrom `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:\n``` bash\nless /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log\n```\nIn this file for all flows that failed we see that the last log entry is the submission of the `Impala Insert` part of the `EXTRACT`, which was still running. This means that another query is hogging all resources for Impala and our flows are waiting to be executed.\n4. Login to Disaster Site Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.mno.gr:7183` and check for resource intensive Impala queries `Clusters > Impala > Queries`. The key resource here is memory as this is the only metric that can be defined in Resource Pools.\nThe query that created the problem was `COMPUTE STATS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`. Pictures are not included because Impala does not report statistics for the `COMPUTE STATS` queries, but given the size of the table and the time of execution it matched. This hypothesis was later confirmed when the same problem appeared on a later `COMPUTE STATS` execution.\n5. We informed the customer to re-run the failed jobs and proposed to stop computing statistics for that table as they did not impact our application.\n``` text\n27/10/22 13:16:01 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nPlease rerun the flow steps that encountered a problem.\nWe are continuing to investigate the root cause of the problem.\n**Workaround**\n27/10/22 13:32:44 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nFollowing the previous answer, the compute statistics on the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table committed many resources on the Calatog Server and the query Coordinator (dr1node02), resulting in REFRESH/INVALIDATE METADATA operations experiencing long execution times and causing jobs to time out. After the compute statistics were completed, Impala released the resources and resumed.\nAs we have communicated in the past, from our perspective the statistics of the table are not necessary. Please let us know if we can disable the production of statistics for this particular table.\n**Resolved**\n```\n6.

Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account and confirm that Datawarehouse Flows have failed from `Monitoring/Monitoring PR/DR` dashboard.\n2. All flows have failed with `Code: 6` which means that the control script has timed-out while monitoring the `EXTRACT` script. The `EXTRACT` step has 2 sub-steps: `Impala Insert` and `Sqoop Export`.\n3. Check logs:\nFrom `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:\n``` bash\nless /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log\n```\nIn this file for all flows that failed we see that the last log entry is the submission of the `Impala Insert` part of the `EXTRACT`, which was still running. This means that another query is hogging all resources for Impala and our flows are waiting to be executed.\n4. Login to Disaster Site Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.mno.gr:7183` and check for resource intensive Impala queries `Clusters > Impala > Queries`. The key resource here is memory as this is the only metric that can be defined in Resource Pools.\nThe query that created the problem was `COMPUTE STATS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`. Pictures are not included because Impala does not report statistics for the `COMPUTE STATS` queries, but given the size of the table and the time of execution it matched. This hypothesis was later confirmed when the same problem appeared on a later `COMPUTE STATS` execution.\n5. We informed the customer to re-run the failed jobs and proposed to stop computing statistics for that table as they did not impact our application.\n``` text\n27/10/22 13:16:01 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nPlease rerun the flow steps that encountered a problem.\nWe are continuing to investigate the root cause of the problem.\n**Workaround**\n27/10/22 13:32:44 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nFollowing the previous answer, the compute statistics on the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table committed many resources on the Calatog Server and the query Coordinator (dr1node02), resulting in REFRESH/INVALIDATE METADATA operations experiencing long execution times and causing jobs to time out. After the compute statistics were completed, Impala released the resources and resumed.\nAs we have communicated in the past, from our perspective the statistics of the table are not necessary. Please let us know if we can disable the production of statistics for this particular table.\n**Resolved**\n```\n6.

Login to grafana to make sure that the alert is about DR SITE. We noticed that there were alerts for IBANK Spark Waiting Batches but not for Visible which predisposes us for an issue with Kudu.\n![ibank_kudu_problem](.media/SD1949713/ibank_kudu_problem.PNG)\n2. Login to Cloudera UI for the DR Site.\n3. From `Charts>Impala Perf` we noticed increased resource commitment through Impala Pool Reserved and Threads charts.\n![Impala Pool Reserved](.media/Impala_pool_reserved.PNG)\n![Threads](.media/threads.PNG)\n4. From `Cloudera Manager>Impala>Queries` we searched for queries that took place at the time the problem raised. We found that the query with ID 6d44d9525a681fb8:5e536ffc00000000 had Threads:CPU Time 10.7h. Upon inspection through `Query Details` we saw that the query was of high complexity with conversions and comparisons with regex.\n![Query](.media/query.PNG)\n5. Through Cloudera logs, we noticed that the query impacted the services in the form of timeouts for Kudu and Hive due to slow communication with Sentry Service.\n![hive_problem](.media/SD1949713/hive_problem.PNG)\n![timeouts_kudu](.media/SD1949713/timeouts_kudu.PNG)\n![sentry_problem](.media/SD1949713/sentry_problem.PNG)\n6. The issue resolved itself once the query completed execution and the resource usage dropped. No manual recovery steps were required. We informed the client that it was due to a high complexity query ran by a normal user that resulted in an increased undertaking of resources.\n## Affected Systems\nDR Site\n---\ntitle: Hue and Impala Query Failure Due to Missing Group Mapping for User E70529\ndescription: User E70529 was unable to execute queries on Hue or via impala-shell due to a missing group name mapping in the system.

The issue stems from physical user workloads (queries, jobs) monopolizing critical system resources\u2014specifically on `dr1node03` where MySQL is hosted. This results in Spark topologies entering a stalled state due to delayed authorization responses from the overloaded MySQL service.\nThe following alert appeared in the grafana system:\n```\n[DR][IBANK] Spark Waiting Batches Alert\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. The following text has been sent to mno/PM and explains the problem, as well as the recommended actions:\n```text\nSpark Waiting Batches Problem: The first and most important problem we have is the \"Spark Waiting Batches\" which opens a ticket for this monitoring. This is due to physical user actions (queries/jobs) that occupy/bind production resources on the disaster site mainly. This results in there being no resources available for the MySQL process (a central point that the entire cluster has a dependency on), the service that does the authorization is unable to process its data in the database and thus causes a delay in the spark topologies until the \"permission denied\" error is resolved. The spark topologies, while up and running, are unable to process the data, as a result of which they continue to execute after the execution of the jobs that occupied the resources on the server where the MySQL service is located has finished. We do not take any action in this nor can we do anything and mno has asked us to close the ticket directly.\nSuggestion: Disable Impala Daemon and YARN Node Manager on dr1node03.mno.gr, pr1node03.mno.gr where the primary MySQL service is located. This will not affect our cluster workload as, as you will see in the attached screenshots:\n1. impala_mean.png: The average memory occupied by Impala Daemon is much smaller than the limit (150GB) that we have set even in the evening hours when all the flows \"close\" the previous day and the largest load is concentrated on the cluster.\n```\n![impala mean usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_mean.PNG)\n``` text\n2. impala_total.png: The total memory commitment from Impala cumulatively for all nodes is at its peak about 500GB less than the total available, which means that by removing a node there will still be room for resources even with the addition of new flows\n```\n![impala total usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_total.PNG)\n```\n3. yarn.png: throughout the day, the available yarn resources are sufficient even with the removal of more than one node\nThe above applies to both sites and the screenshots are from the Disaster site, where the most resources are reserved compared to the 2 sites. It is important as in this MySQL has a dependency on the entire cluster.\n```\n![yarn usage](.media/IM2099957/yarn.PNG)\n``` text\nBy monitoring the remaining nodes of the 2 clusters, we see how they can manage the workload at CPU levels and with the above proposal we will reduce the CPU levels on critical node03 which anyway uses increased CPU for cluster management processes.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nmno Disaster Site\n## Action Points\n- [Issue 66 \u2013 Resource contention on MySQL node (Disable roles)](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/66)  \n- [Issue 196 \u2013 Cluster role optimization for Spark performance](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/196)\n---\ntitle: Impala Connection Pool Exhaustion During HBase Upsert Job Due to Serial Execution on Coordinator\ndescription: The Impala daemon (pr1node04) was overloaded during execution of the Upsert to HBase stage for the IBANK Visible table due to forced single-node execution, resulting in blocked queries, high concurrent connections, and system health alerts; resolved by reverting script changes and disabling HBase quotas.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - impala\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala client connections\n  - impala coordinator\n  - hbase\n  - hbase quotas\n  - upsert to hbase\n  - ibank visible\n  - prodrest\n  - spark\n  - concurrency\n  - impala query failure\n  - cloudera manager\n  - pr1node04\n  - pr1node01\n  - resource bottleneck\n  - impala query logs\n  - impala role restart\n  - IM2097021\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2097021\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: Forced single-node execution of an Impala upsert query exhausted coordinator (pr1node04), blocking concurrent queries and triggering health alerts\n  resolution_summary: Cancelled the long-running query, restarted Impala daemons, removed serial execution flag, and reran the job with parallel execution enabled\n  affected_daemons:\n    - pr1node01\n    - pr1node04\n  related_jobs:\n    - /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh\n  customer_impact: live stream ingestion and production queries were stalled\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2097021 - Multiple Health issues on PR Impala\n## Description\nOn 02/03/2023 at 23:30, multiple Impala daemons across PR Site triggered health alerts in Cloudera Manager due to high concurrent client connections and pause duration warnings. The issue originated from a long-running query used in the IBANK Visible table upsert job, which was executed in single-node mode (via `set num_nodes = 1`). This forced the query to overload the coordinator daemon (pr1node04), which caused query blocking, client connection accumulation, and stalled streaming services.\nToday 02/03/2023 & 23:30 the Following alarms appeared on Cloudera:\n```\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node01)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node02)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node03)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node04)]\n[Pause Duration]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node05)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node06)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site \n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\n![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\n> Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well.\n### Mitigation\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\n1st way: From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\n2nd way: From the url that we monitor the query.\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond.\n### Resolution\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality.\n7. Upon investigation, we concluded that the change to `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` that stops the parallel execution of the query by Impala daemons (set num_nodes = 1) was the cause of the problem.\n8. We scheduled to rerun the `Upsert to HBase` stage the following day after reverting the script to use all Impala daemons for parallel execution.\n### Long-Term Fix\n9.  On 03/03/2023 \n- we disabled HBase quotas for ` PROD_IBANK` namespace on PR Site according to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/22263_mno_HBASE_TUNING.docx) MoP\n- we removed `set num_nodes = 1` from `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`\n- reran the script\n10. The script ran successfully\n## Action Points\n1. We opened [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/67) issue to investigate and deploy a permanent fix for running `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` alongside HBase quotas.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 00:49:29 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe root cause is the same as ticket SD2158913. The job that populates the visible table was canceled after consultation with the customer as it was affecting the live streams.\nThe job will be scheduled to be rerun after consultation.\n```\n---\ntitle: iBank_Migration Historical Batch Job Failed Due to Impala OOM",

Ensures certificate integrity before replacement.\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command: \n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n### Check signed certificates from mno\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer, subject, TLS Web, date.\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n- Check the issuer\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n- Check the subject\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this:\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n- Check the TLS Web\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n- Check the dates\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n- Or with a for loop for all the files\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder: `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ---\n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\nwith the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nwith the certificate from \n`cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \nand copy the section:\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\nand replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`.\nFor example:\n```bash\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has sent to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same. If not, the certificate is wrong\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\nExplains how to safely stop Spark flows and prepare systems for certificate changes.\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n```\n# Signal Spark flows to shut down safely before cert replacement\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep -i PROD_\n```\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep DEVREST\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\nCovers how to copy, import, and activate the new signed certificates across all cluster nodes.\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\nFrom node01:\n#### Node certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n#### JKS certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\n# Import signed certificate into Cloudera's Java Keystore (JKS) on internal nodes\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n\n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\n# Replace haproxy node certificate with newly signed one\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone\n```\nIf after restarting HAProxy the service fails due to missing chain or improper concatenation, rebuild the node certificate manually like this:\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nSteps to restart agents and verify successful service recovery after new certificates are in place.\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nsystemctl status cloudera-scm-agent\nsystemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent \n```\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\" \n# Restart Cloudera agents across all nodes to load new certificates\ndcli -C \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\"\n```\n```\ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server\" \ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-server\"\n```\n### Kudu Checks\nOpen UIs from masters and tablets from internal firefox from edge nodes. Firefox launced with your personal Exxx account.\nLogs from kudu logs on every node:\n`tail -f /var/log/kudu/kudu-tserver.INFO` checks that the number will be equal to this number => `ls /u12/kudu/tablet/data/data/ | grep metadata | wc -l`, when the synchronization is successfully completed.\n#### Start flows\nStart ibank from edge Node as PRODREST\n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\nStart ibank visible from edge Node as PRODREST\n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_VISIBLE_STABLE.sh\n```\nStart online from edge Node as PRODREST\n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\nSimilarly from a DR edge node as DEVREST:\nStart ibank\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\nStart online\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\n### Applications checks\nWhen all Kudu Tablets are synchronized and **all flows are on RUNNING status** then:\nas user PRODREST from an edge node:\n```\nimpala-shell xr1edge.mno.gr -k -ssl\n```\nExecute the following query:\n```\nselect max(timestamp) as time, 'ibank' as application from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream union select max(timestamp) as time, 'online' as application from prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream;\n```\n---\ntitle: SSL Configuration Hardening for Edge Nodes\ndescription: Procedure for updating SSL configurations for httpd, nginx, haproxy, and sshd on PR and DR edge nodes to enforce TLSv1.2, disable weak ciphers, and enhance cryptographic security.\ntags:\n  -

It avoids offset resets by controlling the stop/commit/start sequence of MirrorMakers on PR and DR Kafka clusters using Cloudera Manager, Kerberos-authenticated CLI tools, and timestamp-based offset commits.\n## Scope\nKafka MirrorMaker has been configured with auto.offsets.reset=false. This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n## Setup\n1. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node01 and pr1node04:\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n- Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n2. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06:\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n- Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n3. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node01 and dr1node04:\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n- Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n4. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node05 and dr1node06:\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n- Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n## Procedure\n### Stop All Kafka MirrorMakers Affecting PR Site\n1.

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic.

In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n#### PR replication\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n\n```\n#### DR replication\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n```\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n### Spark Streaming Pipelines\nSpark topologies consume Kafka events and write them to Kudu and HBase, separating full stream and visible-only transactions.\nAfter being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream\nThis topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.

It explains how to enable HBase throttling via Cloudera Manager, configure namespace-specific read and write request limits using the HBase shell, and cleanly remove quotas when no longer needed. Steps include using kinit, navigating HBase processes, and verifying changes through list_quotas.\n## Step 1: Enable Global HBase Quotas via Cloudera Manager\n1. Go to ```Cloudera Manager => HBase => Configuration => HBase Service Advanced configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml```\n2. Add the following configuration:\n```\nName: hbase.quota.enabled\nValue: true\nDescription: enable hbase quotas\n```\n3. Restart HBase service\n## Step 2: Set Namespace-Level HBase Quotas\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n```bash\ncd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\nls \u2013ltr HBASE\ncd <latest hbase process folder>\nkinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n```\n3. Get list of namespaces\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_namespace\n```\n4. Set throttle READ quotas \n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n```\n5. Set throttle WRITE quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n```\n6. Show all quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_quotas\n```\n## Step 3: Remove Namespace-Level Quotas\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n```bash\ncd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\nls \u2013ltr HBASE\ncd <latest hbase process folder>\nkinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n```\n3. Get list of namespaces and list of quotas already set\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_namespace\nlist_quotas\n```\n4. Delete throttle quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => NONE\n```\n5. Verify that quotas have been removed\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_quotas\n```\n---\ntitle: Benchmarking HBase Performance with YCSB on Lab\ndescription: Procedure to benchmark HBase performance using YCSB on the lab environment with and without quotas applied, including setup, workload execution, and quota testing for read and write limits.\ntags:\n  - hbase\n  - ycsb\n  - benchmarking\n  - quotas\n  - read-quota\n  - write-quota\n  - lab\n  - performance-testing\n  - bigstreamer\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer Lab\n  system: jakarta\n  host_ip: 999.999.999.999\n  tool: YCSB 0.17.0\n  table_name: usertable\n  namespaces:\n    - default\n    - quotas_test\n  quotas:\n    - read: 20req/sec\n    - write: 20req/sec\n  workloads: [workloada, workloadb, workloadc, workloadd, workloade, workloadf]\n  hbase_config_path: /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n---\n# Benchmarking HBASE on Lab with YCSB Tool\n## Introduction\nOur purpose was to run performance tests on a created Hbase table on Lab environment and document the results which will be used as a point of reference to evaluate the efficacy of quotas that will be applied. After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Create and Pre-Split HBase Table\nThis section creates the usertable using pre-splitting to distribute load evenly across regionservers.\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n```bash\nhbase shell\nn_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', { SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map { |i| \"user#{1000 + i * (9999 - 1000) / n_splits}\" } }\n```\n## Install and Configure YCSB\nThis section describes downloading YCSB, extracting it, and pointing it to the HBase configuration directory.\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n```bash\ntar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n```bash\nmkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\ncd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\ncp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n```bash\ncd ycsb-0.17.0\n```\n## Baseline HBase Performance Without Quotas\nRun workloads A\u2013F with YCSB against HBase before applying any read/write quotas to establish baseline metrics.\n- Load the data\n```bash\nbin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n```bash\nbin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n```bash\nhbase shell\ndisable 'usertable'\ndrop 'usertable'\nexists 'usertable'\nn_splits = 300\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', { SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map { |i| \"user#{1000 + i * (9999 -

IM2095966 - Failed Batch Job on Grafana\n## Description\nThe MergeBatch job for the IBank_Ingestion pipeline failed on 28/02/2023 on the PR Site with a Grafana alert. The failure occurred during the `JOB` component execution and was traced to Impala resource exhaustion caused by HBase write quotas and high data volume at end-of-month.\nThe following failed batch job appeared in the Grafana system:\n```\napplication :  IBank_Ingestion\njob_name : MergeBatch\ncomponent : JOB\ndate : 28-02-2023\nstatus : FAILED\ndescription :\nhost : pr1edge01.mno.gr\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. We identified the failed step using the alarm name. Steps `MSSQL Sqoop Import (Migration)` and `Insert to Service Audit` had been executed successfully. We rerun the `Merge Batch` according to [this](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch).\n2. The job had not completed at approximately 9.pm on 01/03/2023 we terminated the job after communication with the customer in order for the night flow to run without any problems. We scheduled to rerun the job in the following day after the completion of the daily MergeBatch.\n3. On 02/03/2023 we reran the job in 3 patches \n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 00:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\" \"2023-03-01 00:00:00\"\n```\n4. The `Upsert to HBase` stage that synchronises the `Visible` table caused an Impala problem during which Impala stopped to process this job as well as other requests.\n5. The problem is described below.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG.

At this time, the DR has processed until 18:00, while the PR has processed the data until 12:00. The executions on both sites are being monitored so that they can be resubmitted in case of a problem.\n01/03/23 21:11:19 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nFollowing our telephone communication, the job has been stopped and will be re-executed tomorrow in order to avoid problems with the evening streams.\n```\n---\ntitle: Impala Connection Pool Exhaustion During HBase Upsert Job Due to Serial Execution on Coordinator\ndescription: The Impala daemon (pr1node04) was overloaded during execution of the Upsert to HBase stage for the IBANK Visible table due to forced single-node execution, resulting in blocked queries, high concurrent connections, and system health alerts; resolved by reverting script changes and disabling HBase quotas.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - impala\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala client connections\n  - impala coordinator\n  - hbase\n  - hbase quotas\n  - upsert to hbase\n  - ibank visible\n  - prodrest\n  - spark\n  - concurrency\n  - impala query failure\n  - cloudera manager\n  - pr1node04\n  - pr1node01\n  - resource bottleneck\n  - impala query logs\n  - impala role restart\n  - IM2097021\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2097021\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: Forced single-node execution of an Impala upsert query exhausted coordinator (pr1node04), blocking concurrent queries and triggering health alerts\n  resolution_summary: Cancelled the long-running query, restarted Impala daemons, removed serial execution flag, and reran the job with parallel execution enabled\n  affected_daemons:\n    - pr1node01\n    - pr1node04\n  related_jobs:\n    - /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh\n  customer_impact: live stream ingestion and production queries were stalled\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2097021 - Multiple Health issues on PR Impala\n## Description\nOn 02/03/2023 at 23:30, multiple Impala daemons across PR Site triggered health alerts in Cloudera Manager due to high concurrent client connections and pause duration warnings. The issue originated from a long-running query used in the IBANK Visible table upsert job, which was executed in single-node mode (via `set num_nodes = 1`). This forced the query to overload the coordinator daemon (pr1node04), which caused query blocking, client connection accumulation, and stalled streaming services.\nToday 02/03/2023 & 23:30 the Following alarms appeared on Cloudera:\n```\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node01)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node02)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node03)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node04)]\n[Pause Duration]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node05)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node06)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site \n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\n![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\n> Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well.\n### Mitigation\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\n1st way: From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\n2nd way: From the url that we monitor the query.\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond.\n### Resolution\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality.",

Login to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `mtuser` with sudo\n2. Inspect logs of *CSI fix* flow. Nfgh that filename format is `CSI_fix_<mmddyyyy>_w<week>.txt` and that there is a 2 day delay between the export time and the exported data. In this case there was a problem with the file containing data for 2020-11-22 which was exported at 2020-11-24. So we checked the logs for 2020-11-24. \n```bash\ncd /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log\nless sai_csi.cron.20201124.log\n```\n3. Check if the source table contained data for the export date.\nIn `sai_csi.cron.20201124.log`:\n``` bash\nQuery: use `sai`\nQuery: select nvl ... from sai.cube_indicators_it where par_dt='20201122'\n...\nFetched 0 row(s) in 0.06s\nProblem with 20201122.\n```\n4. Check if the source table contains data for this date. Please nfgh that the source table is just a view of table `brond.cube_indicators`.\n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2458393,20201123\n```\n5. Identify Missing Data in brond.cube_indicators. Since 3 dates are missing 2020/11/20-22, we need to run the workflow that populates `brond.cube_indicators`. But first we have to make sure all its table dependecies are loaded. Execute the following queries in an impala-shell or an Impala editor in Hue and make sure not only that partitions exist for those dates but also that there are an identical amount of lines.\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_retrains_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20201118'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\n...\ncount(*),par_dt\n2499833,20201118\n2497948,20201119\n*2496522,20201120*\n*2497810,20201121*\n*2497480,20201122*\n2496932,20201123\n2497130,20201124\n2505791,20201125\n``` \nExecute the same query for tables:\n- brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp\n- brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq\n- radius.radacct_hist\n- brond.brond_retrains_hist\n- brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nThis confirms the root cause: the brond.cube_indicators table lacked data for these dates, resulting in empty CSI_fix exports.\n6. Rerun Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators for Missing Partitions. Run Cube_Indicators workflow. Login to Hue as intra and navigate to Workflows > Dashboards > Coordinators. Search for `Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators` and click on the coordinator to view its executions. Select **one** at a time of the executions that need to be repeated. Nfgh that `brond.cube_indicators` is populated with a 2 day delay so if we want to load data for 2020-11-20 we have to execute the workflow of 2020-11-22. Select the execution from the check box and click `Rerun`. \n7. After each workflow execution repeat the query of step 4 to verify that table has been loaded. \n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2454321,20201120\n2458393,20201123\n```\n8. Gather dates that need to be exported. As we saw in step 5 the source table was empty for 3 partitions: 20201120, 20201121, 20201122. The files produced for them was empty. Verify by checking `/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log`:\n```bash\n2020-11-21 09:01:39  CSI_fix_11212020_w47.txt  20201119  2453089\n2020-11-22 09:00:43  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  0\n2020-11-23 09:28:14  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  0\n2020-11-24 09:01:01  CSI_fix_11242020_w47.txt  20201122  0\n2020-11-25 09:03:13  CSI_fix_11252020_w48.txt  20201123  2458393\n```\n*CSI fix* provides a mechanism to avoid manual re-export of empty files. The most recent date of an empty file is stored in a table and automatically exported with the next execution. To view the date stored issue the query:\n```bash\nselect * from refdata.mediation_csi_load_info;\n...\nload_time,flow_name\nNULL,sai.mob\n20201122,sai.fix\n```\nSo we don't need to export manually date 20201122, only dates 20201120 & 20201121.\n9. Manually Export CSI_fix Files Using export_csi_fix.sh. Finally, to export the files we have to repeat step 1 and execute the export script **sequentially** for the desired dates + 2 days:\n```bash\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201122 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201123 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n```\nThis confirms the missing CSI_fix files were regenerated successfully with the expected number of lines.\n10. Afterwards check the reconciliation log file that files have been exported:\n```bash\nless /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log\n...\n2020-11-25 10:46:40  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  4915294\n2020-11-25 10:51:17  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  2457858\n```\nThe first one contains more lines as it includes dates 20201120 & 20201122.\n## Affected Systems\nabc Bigstreamer Backend\n---\ntitle: IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch Failure Due to OOM - Recovery via Parallel Execution\ndescription: The IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch Spark job on DR site failed due to Out Of Memory (OOM) error.

However, the chatbot response does not provide detailed instructions on how to perform these tasks.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the chatbot response and the retrieved context, I would give a score of 3 out of 5.\n\n### **Feedback:**\nThe chatbot response provides some relevant information, but it does not fully address the specific requirements and dependencies mentioned in the retrieved context. To improve the response, the chatbot should provide more detailed instructions on how to perform the tasks mentioned in the retrieved context.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 3\n\nThis score indicates that the chatbot response is somewhat grounded in the retrieved context, but it does not fully address the specific requirements and dependencies mentioned in the retrieved context. To improve the response, the chatbot should provide more detailed instructions on how to perform the tasks mentioned in the retrieved context.",

        "chatbot_answer": " The process for identifying and resolving duplicate records in the `energy_efficiency.cell` table involves several steps. First, you need to access Streamsets for the Energy Efficiency pipeline. Then, you can use Impala queries to detect duplicate records in the `energy_efficiency.cell` table. Once duplicates are identified, you can safely remove them by overwriting partitions using Impala. It is also recommended to create a backup of the original table before making any changes.\n```",

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999).

It explains how to enable HBase throttling via Cloudera Manager, configure namespace-specific read and write request limits using the HBase shell, and cleanly remove quotas when no longer needed. Steps include using kinit, navigating HBase processes, and verifying changes through list_quotas.\n## Step 1: Enable Global HBase Quotas via Cloudera Manager\n1. Go to ```Cloudera Manager => HBase => Configuration => HBase Service Advanced configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml```\n2. Add the following configuration:\n```\nName: hbase.quota.enabled\nValue: true\nDescription: enable hbase quotas\n```\n3.

Get list of namespaces\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_namespace\n```\n4. Set throttle READ quotas \n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n```\n5. Set throttle WRITE quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n```\n6. Show all quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_quotas\n```\n## Step 3: Remove Namespace-Level Quotas\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n```bash\ncd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\nls \u2013ltr HBASE\ncd <latest hbase process folder>\nkinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n```\n3. Get list of namespaces and list of quotas already set\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_namespace\nlist_quotas\n```\n4. Delete throttle quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => NONE\n```\n5. Verify that quotas have been removed\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_quotas\n```\n---\ntitle: IBank MergeBatch Job Failed Due to HBase Quotas and Impala Resource Exhaustion\ndescription: The MergeBatch job for IBank_Ingestion failed due to Impala daemon resource exhaustion triggered by HBase namespace quotas and large data volume; workaround involved disabling quotas and rerunning in distributed mode.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - ibank\n  - mergebatch\n  - batch job\n  - impala\n  - hbase\n  - quotas\n  - pr1node04\n  - spark\n  - yarn\n  - resource exhaustion\n  - visible table\n  - service audit\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala concurrency\n  - code 6\n  - IM2095966\n  - impala parallelism\n  - spark-submit\n  - job retry\n  - prodrest\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2095966\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: HBase write quotas limited Impala to a single daemon, which crashed under end-of-month load, causing Impala connection pool exhaustion and failure of the MergeBatch job\n  resolution_summary: MergeBatch was rerun in 3 time windows after disabling quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace to allow full Impala daemon usage\n  workaround: quota removal and distributed rerun\n  affected_nodes:\n    - pr1node04\n    - pr1edge01\n  impacted_component: IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch (Spark + Impala + HBase)\n  customer_impact: night flows disrupted, visible table update delayed\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2095966 - Failed Batch Job on Grafana\n## Description\nThe MergeBatch job for the IBank_Ingestion pipeline failed on 28/02/2023 on the PR Site with a Grafana alert. The failure occurred during the `JOB` component execution and was traced to Impala resource exhaustion caused by HBase write quotas and high data volume at end-of-month.\nThe following failed batch job appeared in the Grafana system:\n```\napplication :  IBank_Ingestion\njob_name : MergeBatch\ncomponent : JOB\ndate : 28-02-2023\nstatus : FAILED\ndescription :\nhost : pr1edge01.mno.gr\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. We identified the failed step using the alarm name. Steps `MSSQL Sqoop Import (Migration)` and `Insert to Service Audit` had been executed successfully. We rerun the `Merge Batch` according to [this](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch).\n2. The job had not completed at approximately 9.pm on 01/03/2023 we terminated the job after communication with the customer in order for the night flow to run without any problems. We scheduled to rerun the job in the following day after the completion of the daily MergeBatch.\n3. On 02/03/2023 we reran the job in 3 patches \n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 00:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\" \"2023-03-01 00:00:00\"\n```\n4. The `Upsert to HBase` stage that synchronises the `Visible` table caused an Impala problem during which Impala stopped to process this job as well as other requests.\n5. The problem is described below.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG. Poulas\n03/03/23 00:53:26 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe service audit has been filled on the PR Site. The job that fills the visible table is pending as it was canceled in the context of ticket SD2159021.\n02/03/23 15:56:38 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe execution on both sites started after the scheduled execution of the Merge Batch for 01/03/2023, which has been completed without a problem. At this time, the DR has processed until 18:00, while the PR has processed the data until 12:00. The executions on both sites are being monitored so that they can be resubmitted in case of a problem.\n01/03/23 21:11:19 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nFollowing our telephone communication, the job has been stopped and will be re-executed tomorrow in order to avoid problems with the evening streams.\n```\n---\ntitle: Impala Connection Pool Exhaustion During HBase Upsert Job Due to Serial Execution on Coordinator\ndescription: The Impala daemon (pr1node04) was overloaded during execution of the Upsert to HBase stage for the IBANK Visible table due to forced single-node execution, resulting in blocked queries, high concurrent connections, and system health alerts; resolved by reverting script changes and disabling HBase quotas.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - impala\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala client connections\n  - impala coordinator\n  - hbase\n  - hbase quotas\n  - upsert to hbase\n  - ibank visible\n  - prodrest\n  - spark\n  - concurrency\n  - impala query failure\n  - cloudera manager\n  - pr1node04\n  - pr1node01\n  - resource bottleneck\n  - impala query logs\n  - impala role restart\n  - IM2097021\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2097021\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: Forced single-node execution of an Impala upsert query exhausted coordinator (pr1node04), blocking concurrent queries and triggering health alerts\n  resolution_summary: Cancelled the long-running query, restarted Impala daemons, removed serial execution flag, and reran the job with parallel execution enabled\n  affected_daemons:\n    - pr1node01\n    - pr1node04\n  related_jobs:\n    - /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh\n  customer_impact: live stream ingestion and production queries were stalled\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2097021 - Multiple Health issues on PR Impala\n## Description\nOn 02/03/2023 at 23:30, multiple Impala daemons across PR Site triggered health alerts in Cloudera Manager due to high concurrent client connections and pause duration warnings. The issue originated from a long-running query used in the IBANK Visible table upsert job, which was executed in single-node mode (via `set num_nodes = 1`). This forced the query to overload the coordinator daemon (pr1node04), which caused query blocking, client connection accumulation, and stalled streaming services.\nToday 02/03/2023 & 23:30 the Following alarms appeared on Cloudera:\n```\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node01)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node02)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node03)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node04)]\n[Pause Duration]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node05)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node06)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site \n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\n![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\n> Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well.\n### Mitigation\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\n1st way: From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\n2nd way: From the url that we monitor the query.\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond.\n### Resolution\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality.",

Also all flows ran without errors during the issue.\n15. Customer informed us that the `nfs` storage was full and after their actions it's ok. We checked the `CM` and all the services now is healthy.\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThis problem occurred due to `nfs` unavaliability.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\nThe issue was caused by the nfs storage used on the nodes of both clusters becoming full. This resulted in the host monitor of the cloudera management services timeouting as it was unable to collect metrics for each filesystem of the nodes.\nRelevant screenshots are attached showing the above causes of the issue.\nThroughout the issue, the flows were up and running as seen in grafana as it was a malfunction of the management services resulting in the incorrect image of all services in Cloudera Manager PR & DR respectively.\nAfter space was freed up on the nfs, both clusters returned to good health.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster/Primary Site\n---\ntitle: HDFS Block Count Alert on dr1node09 Due to service_audit_old Table Fragmentation\ndescription: An HDFS alert was triggered on the Disaster Site due to an excessive number of blocks on dr1node09 caused by unmanaged historical partitions in the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old table.

Investigation showed that the alert was caused by excessive block count due to the absence of a retention policy for the `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old` table in Hive. Manual purging of old partitions was performed to mitigate the issue.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to Cloudera Manager in DR and check the alarm\n2. It was a block count alarm on `dr1node09`\n3. Login to `dr1edge01` with your personal account and execute `firefox` to view the Namenode UI.\n4. Go to `https://dr1node02.mno.gr:50470` and from there in the tab `Datanodes`. Order the datanodes using the block count by desceding order to overview the situation.\n5. Change user to PRODREST and use HDFS command or Impala query to check how many partitions exist in `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. This is a big table that has no retention mechanism yet so its data are stored in many blocks. HDFS command is `hdfs dfs -ls /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old` and Impala query is `show partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. In either case observe how many `par_dt` directories exist.\n6. In our case there were at least 6 months in there so we informed mno. Sample customer notification:\n```text\nRegarding ticket SD1734269, the error shown in Cloudera Manager refers to a block count threshold exceeded on dr1node09 and is due to the increased number of blocks stored on the new nodes dr1node07-10. The impact on the datanode lies in the performance as the metadata for the blocks it has in memory does not fit.\nFrom the investigation we did in the HDFS data, we saw that there are many files in the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old table. Specifically, there is history in it from 01/03.",

The applications that handle the HTTP calls are installed on the edge servers of both sites. At normal operation only one site is active. These applications are deployed on top of Wildfly instances. There are four sets of Wildfly installations one for the `ibank` flow and one for the `online` flow and two others for applications developed by mno. All application servers are managed by `supervisord` owned by `root` user.\n**DEV/QA Information**:\nThe information below are written for the Production enviroment. There is a development/QA environment that runs only on DR site. In case of a problem the paths are exactly the same if you substitute the `prod` with the `dev` prefix. For the networking part of the DEV/QA environment use the [Network Information](#network-information) chapter\n### Glossary\n- NetScaler: Loadbalancer managed by mno. It handles SSL offloading\n- VIP: Virtual IP of the Loadbalancer\n- SNIP: IP of the Loadbalancer that initiates the connection to Wildfly instances\n- Health check: Endpoint that the Loadbalancer uses to determine if a specific Wildfly instance is active. It expects a `HTTP 200/OK` response\n## Setup\n### Internet Banking Wildfly Instances\n#### prodrestib\nHandles ingestion and queries for the Internet Banking (`ibank`) flow.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Port**: `8080`\n**Health Check Endpoint**: `/trlogibank/app`\n**Supervisor Configuration**: `/etc/supervisor.d/wildfly-prodrestib.ini`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\n#### prodrestibmetrics\nHosts applications developed by mno and accessed by the Internet Banking backend servers. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Port**: `8081`\n**Health Check Endpoint**: `/ibankmetrics/app`\n**Supervisor Configuration**: `/etc/supervisor.d/wildfly-prodrestibmetrics.ini`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `Managed by mno`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestibmetrics/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestibmetrics/access.log`\n### Internet Banking Loadbalancer farms\nThere are two active Loadbalancers for Internet Banking.

Troubleshoot from the command line:\nFrom `mncdsw1` as root (use personal account and then sudo):\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -w -A # Wait a pod to fail (namespace should be like default-user-XXX)\n# After a while, a pod has failed, describe it\nkubectl describe pod -n default-user-XXX XXXXXXXX\n```\n### 3. Identify Root Cause from CNI/Weave Logs\n```logs\nEvents\nWarning  FailedCreatePodSandBox  10s                    kubelet, wrkcdsw4.bigdata.abc.gr  Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = [failed to set up sandbox container \"...\" network for pod \"XXXXXXXX\": networkPlugin cni failed to set up pod \"XXXXXXXX_default\" network: unable to allocate IP address: Post http://127.0.0.1:6784/ip/....: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6784: connect: connection refused, failed to clean up sandbox container \"....\" network for pod \"XXXXXXXX\": networkPlugin cni failed to teardown pod \"XXXXXXXX_default\" network: Delete http://127.0.0.1:6784/ip/....: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6784: connect: connection refused]\n```\nThis error points us to the CNI plugin\nCheck the logs for the weave pods:\n``` bash\nkubectl logs -n kube-system weave-net-XXXXX\n# Weave pod in wrkcdsw4 has stopped logging events\n```\nThe pod was not responding and could not be deleted.\n### 4. Restore Weave Functionality by Restarting Docker\n7. Restart the docker daemon to restart all containers on `wrkcdsw4`\n_At the time of the issue, CDSW had stale configuration that required full restart (outage) which was not desirable_\nTo avoid applying the settings, restart the service with the same configuration by triggering a restart by `supervisord` deployed as part of the Cloudera agent\n#### Details\n ![Danger ahead](https://media3.giphy.com/media/vvzMdSygQejBIejeRO/200w.gif?cid=6c09b952aacsm9yssw6k6q0z5v8ejuy82rjpvw6qdhglcwpu&rid=200w.gif&ct=g)\nFrom wrkcdsw4 as root (use personal account and then sudo):\n```bash\n/opt/cloudera/cm-agent/bin/supervisorctl -c /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/supervisor/supervisord.conf status | grep DOCKER\n# Sample\n# 145071-cdsw-CDSW_DOCKER          RUNNING   pid 39353, uptime 29 days, 0:40:20\n/opt/cloudera/cm-agent/bin/supervisorctl -c /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/supervisor/supervisord.conf restart 145071-cdsw-CDSW_DOCKER\n```\n### 5. Confirm Recovery and Notify Customer\n8. Check that the node is operational after the restart\nFrom `mncdsw1` as root (use personal account and then sudo):\n```bash\ncdsw status # You might have to wait a few minutes\n```\n9.

Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox\n2. At the YARN UI search for `PRODREST` and sort by End date. You will find the failed application.\n3. From the UI we saw that Spark exited due to errors related to HBase timeouts.\n4. From DR site's Cloudera Manager we saw that HBase Regionservers restarted due to Out-Of-Memory errors and are now healthy again.\n5. Using this [document](/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/online.md#spark-streaming) we re-submitted the failed topology and the alarm was cleared:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n6. We informed the customer that a **workaround** has been implemented. The ticket status from this point is \"Workaround Provided\".\n7. The logs and resources charts from Cloudera Manager did not indicate a specific reason for the restarts.\n8. After investigating HBase tables we identified that 2 tables from the `PROD_BANK` namespace although they have low traffic overall, they have high traffic per region. Since each region is hosted on only one Regionserver, so this application pattern creates hotspots on specific servers and does not utilize the whole cluster properly.

Inform the customer of the findings\n```\nThe problem did not occur today. Looking at the overall picture of HBase, we notice that its usage has increased significantly. Specifically, we see tables in the Namespace \"PROD:BANK\" with a high workload throughout the day and with an application-level configuration that creates uneven load distribution between Region Servers.\nYou should immediately proceed with the actions that have been suggested for benchmarking and tuning HBase as a service and the applications that use it in order to optimize its use.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster Site HBase\n---\ntitle: Internet Banking - Data Ingestion and Processing\ndescription: Complete documentation of the Internet Banking data pipeline: streaming ingestion, batch migration, Spark processing, Kafka, Wildfly, retention policies, Oozie jobs, and operational troubleshooting across DR/PR clusters.\ntags:\n  - ibank\n  - internet banking\n  - spark streaming\n  - kafka\n  - kudu\n  - hbase\n  - wildfly\n  - retention\n  - migration\n  - sqoop\n  - batch processing\n  - cron jobs\n  - troubleshooting\n  - monitoring\n  - cloudera manager\n  - impala\n  - data pipeline\n  - RAG\n  - BigStreamer\n---\n# Internet Banking\n## Stream\nProcesses user transaction events in real-time from Wildfly servers to Kafka, then through Spark Streaming to Kudu and HBase for persistent storage.\n### Wilfly Transaction Receiver\nWildfly applications receive HTTP POST requests with transaction events from Internet Banking backend servers and forward them to Kafka topics.\nUser generated events are sent to Wildfly instances installed at edge servers as HTTP POST requests.

We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`.\nFor example:\n```bash\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has sent to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same. If not, the certificate is wrong\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\nExplains how to safely stop Spark flows and prepare systems for certificate changes.\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n```\n# Signal Spark flows to shut down safely before cert replacement\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep -i PROD_\n```\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep DEVREST\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\nCovers how to copy, import, and activate the new signed certificates across all cluster nodes.\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\nFrom node01:\n#### Node certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n#### JKS certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\n# Import signed certificate into Cloudera's Java Keystore (JKS) on internal nodes\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n\n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\n# Replace haproxy node certificate with newly signed one\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone\n```\nIf after restarting HAProxy the service fails due to missing chain or improper concatenation, rebuild the node certificate manually like this:\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nSteps to restart agents and verify successful service recovery after new certificates are in place.\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy.

Login to\n**pr1node01** and update the repository with the new packages:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo --update .\n```\n## Step 3: Upgrade Java on Edge Hosts\n### Preparation\nBefore upgrading the edge nodes, their resources must be moved to other nodes and a backup\nof the old java be made. Login to each edge node:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# cp -rap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64/  /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n### Execution\nInside each edge node, update the java package using **YUM**:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum update java-1.8\n```\nCopy the old certificates into the new installation directory and run the update alternatives\ntool where you input the new version when prompted:\n```bash\n# cp -ap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts \\\n/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<new version>-amd64/jre/lib/security/\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\nIf everything is OK unstandby the node and check each wildfly instance's access and\nserver logs for the following:\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/server.log`: There are no undeployed WARs\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/access.log`: Everything is reporting HTTP 200 status\nDetailed wildfly information and management instructions can be found\n[here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/manage_wildfly.md).\n## Step 4: Rollback to Previous Java Version\nLogin to each edge node and downgrade using the update-alternatives and inputting the previous version:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\n---\ntitle: Postgres 14 Upgrade Procedure\ndescription: Detailed instructions for upgrading PostgreSQL from version 9.5 to 14 on PR and DR edge nodes in the BigStreamer environment, including data backup, repository setup, YUM installation, and rollback steps.\ntags:\n  -

Body starts with: `Could not perform radacct_enriched housekeeping on sftp server`\n  - Alerts that indicate general failures without specific cause:\n    - Body starts with: `Insert data failed` and then lists the status for each file\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- If an alert has been received, use the message from the e-mail to determine the root cause for the failure.\n  - For failures with Input SFTP server:\n    - Inform abc in order to check the Input SFTP Server\n    - If abc does not detect any problems, check connectivity:\n      From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n      ``` bash\n      su - radius\n      sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n      # Check for files\n      sftp> ls -l\n      ```\n  - For failures with Trustcenter SFTP Server:\n    - Check `unc2.bigdata.abc.gr` for any errors\n- If no alerts have been received or the problem is not specified determine the root cause for the failure with the following steps:\n  - Check for failed executions\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ```bash\n    curl --location --request GET 'http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800/monitoring/api/jobstatus/find?application=RADIUS&status=FAILED&operativePartition=<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.:20220518>'\n    ```\n    For additional query parameters check [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/common-dev/apps/monitoring/monitoring-devops/-/wikis/API-Functional-Spec#fields)\n    or check via the corresponding [Grafana dashboard](https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/J4KPyBoVk/radius-dashboard?orgId=1&from=now-2d&to=now)\n  - Check the logs for the failed execution.\n- After the underlying problem has been corrected the next execution of the flow will load any files that have been delayed or failed to be loaded in a previous execution.\n- If the customer requests to load specific files after they have been processed by the flow. **In order to avoid duplicate data we have to reload the whole partition.**\n  - Ensure the files are still available on the SFTP server\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n    # Check for files covering the whole date affected\n    sftp> ls -l *.LOADED\n    ```\n  - Suspend coordinator `Radius_Load_Coordinator`\n  - Drop partitions that were not properly loaded from following tables\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    kinit -kt /home/users/radius/radius.keytab radius\n    impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr -k --ssl\n    ```\n    - In case of radarchive category of file:\n      ```sql\n      alter table radius.radarchive drop partitions (par_dt=\"<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.: 20220915>\")\n      ```\n    - In case of radacct category of file:\n      ```sql\n      alter table radius.radacct drop partitions (par_dt=\"<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.: 20220915>\")\n      ```\n  - Connect to SFTP server and rename files with filename timestamp equal to above-mentioned partition(s) and the same category:\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n    # For every file you need to reload\n    sftp> rename <filename>.LOADED <filename>\n    ```\n  - Resume coordinator `Radius_Load_Coordinator`\n## Kudu Housekeeping and Compute Statistics Flow\nThis secondary flow enforces retention on the Kudu table radius.radreference and recomputes Impala statistics for radarchive and radacct daily.\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Apply 5-day rention to<br>Kudu: radius.radreference]\n  B[Compute Impala Statistics for<br>radius.radarchive<br>radius.radacct]\n```\n- **User**: `radius`  \n- **Coordinator**: `Radius_Kudu_Retention_Coordinator` \n- **Workflow**: `Radius_Kudu_Retention_Workflow`\n- **HDFS path**: `/user/radius`\n- **Runs**: `once a day at 2:25 (UTC)`\n- **Config file**: `hdfs: /user/radius/Kudu_Retention_And_Compute_Stats/settings.ini`\n- **Logs**: From Hue go to `Job Browser -> Workflows` and filter with the workflow name\n**Alerts**:\n- Not monitored\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check the logs for the failed execution.\n- After the underlying problem has been corrected the next execution of the flow will apply the correct retention to the Kudu table and compute the missing statistics.\n---\ntitle: Radius Data Recovery and Ingestion after Cluster Downtime\ndescription: End-to-end recovery of missing hourly RADIUS and RADARCHIVE files due to system outage, including SFTP retrieval, ingestion via local `.trn` config override, and verification in hist tables.\ntags:\n  -

This document covers the radius and radarchive flow gaps and the manual restoration procedure used to load missing files into Hive hist tables.\nPlease immediately load all the data for all the hours and for all the flows (sai,vantage,radius etc) for the period of time the system was not working and run all the aggregated tables. We should also be sent a summary table with the relevant information so that we know if and in which streams there are data deficiencies.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `intra` with sudo.\n2. Check files that have not been ingested. As you can see, there is a gap for radacct 20201220 and for radarchive between 3:00 - 16:30\n```bash\n[intra@un2 ~]$ hdfs dfs -ls -t -r /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_orig_files\n...\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive  838634257 2020-12-20 02:11 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_orig_files/RAD___radacct_2020-12-20_01-30.csv.20201220_021002.utc\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive  837624575 2020-12-20 03:11 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_orig_files/RAD___radacct_2020-12-20_03-00.csv.20201220_031003.utc\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive  840322537 2020-12-20 17:11 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_orig_files/RAD___radacct_2020-12-20_16-30.csv.20201220_171002.utc\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive  839948348 2020-12-20 18:11 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_orig_files/RAD___radacct_2020-12-20_18-00.csv.20201220_181002.utc\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive  840668651 2020-12-20 20:11 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_orig_files/RAD___radacct_2020-12-20_19-30.csv.20201220_201002.utc\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive  840847248 2020-12-20 21:11 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_orig_files/RAD___radacct_2020-12-20_21-00.csv.20201220_211002.utc\n...\n[intra@un2 ~]$ hdfs dfs -ls -t -r /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radarchive_orig_files\nFound 30 items\n...\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive 1694918420 2020-12-17 05:14 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radarchive_orig_files/RAD___radarchive_2020-12-16.csv.20201217_051003.utc\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive 1635182557 2020-12-18 05:14 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radarchive_orig_files/RAD___radarchive_2020-12-17.csv.20201218_051002.utc\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive 1618497473 2020-12-19 05:14 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radarchive_orig_files/RAD___radarchive_2020-12-18.csv.20201219_051002.utc\n-rwxrwx--x+  3 hive hive 1522580860 2020-12-21 05:13 /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radarchive_orig_files/RAD___radarchive_2020-12-20.csv.20201221_051002.utc\n```\nA gap was observed between `radacct_2020-12-20_03-00.csv` and `radacct_2020-12-20_16-30.csv`. \nAlso, radarchive data for `2020-12-19` was missing.\n3.

The steps outlined in the response, including data ingestion from an external SFTP server into HDFS, processing and transformation of the ingested data, loading of the processed data into Hive tables for data warehousing and analytics, and loading of the processed data into Kudu tables for fast and efficient data storage and retrieval for real-time analytics and reporting, demonstrate a good understanding of the Radius session data processing and storage pipeline using Hive and Kudu.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the chatbot response lacks specific details and examples that are present in the reference answer. For instance, the reference answer mentions that \"Radius data from SFTP is loaded into Hive staging tables\", which provides a more specific and detailed explanation of the data loading process. Additionally, the reference answer provides an example of how the `radacct` files are processed into `radius.radacct_stg`, which helps to illustrate the data processing pipeline in a more concrete and tangible way.\n\nIn light of these observations, it is clear that while the chatbot response demonstrates a good understanding of the Radius session data processing and storage pipeline using Hive and Kudu, it lacks the specific details and examples that are present in the reference answer.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 4**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Feedback:** The chatbot response provides a detailed overview of how Radius session data is processed and stored using Hive and Kudu.
