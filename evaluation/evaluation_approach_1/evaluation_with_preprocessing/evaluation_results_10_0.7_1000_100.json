        "ground_truth": "The Brond Retrains pipeline retrieves `.csv.gz` files via SFTP, renames them with `.LOADED`, parses them using scripts in `/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/`, uploads them to HDFS at `/ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains`, and loads them into the `brond.brond_retrains_hist` Hive table via Oozie workflow `Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW`.",
        "chatbot_answer": " The Brond Retrains pipeline handles raw file ingestion and Hive loading through a series of steps. First, it retrieves raw files from an SFTP server using the `SFTP` component. These files are then parsed and processed before being loaded into HDFS directories. Finally, the data is loaded into Hive tables using Oozie scheduling. The pipeline also includes monitoring and error resolution components to ensure that any issues are quickly identified and addressed. Overall, the Brond Retrains pipeline provides a robust and reliable solution for ingesting raw files and loading them into Hive tables.",

The first step involves checking the monitoring table for job status records related to the def_NETWORK_MAP flow. This is a practical approach as it leverages existing logging mechanisms.\n\n2. The second step suggests verifying the data in the destination Hive tables by running queries against them using Beeline. This hands-on verification method ensures that not only has the data been transferred, but it also exists in the expected form and location within Hive.\n\n3. The third step involves inspecting log files associated with the def_NETWORK_MAP flow for any error messages or exceptions. This proactive approach to troubleshooting can help identify issues early on, potentially preventing more significant problems down the line.\n\nHowever, when comparing this response to the reference answer provided, it becomes apparent that the chatbot's suggestions, while comprehensive and well-intentioned, do not align perfectly with the specific steps outlined in the reference answer. \n\nThe reference answer points towards checking specific log files (`104.OneTicket_OraData_Import_Hive.<UNIX-TIME>.log`) and querying an Oracle control table for export control records targeting 'ACTIVITY'. These precise actions are not mentioned in the chatbot's response.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 3**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Feedback:** The chatbot provides a well-structured and detailed approach to verifying successful data transfers.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n| `initiate_export_*.sh` | Triggers category-specific KPI exports | `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/` |\n| `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` | Prepares & posts payload to SM App | `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/` |\n| `query_sm.sh` | Constructs the payload for SM App | Same as above |\n| `sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` | Manual runner across intervals | Same as above |\nList of helper scripts used by the SLA cronjob and their role in preparing and triggering requests.\nIn addition to the IPVPN-SM application, IPVPN-SM utilizes certain bash scripts. Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n### CPU and Memory\n#### Main script\nA procedure is executed periodically that triggers IPVPN-SM App to compute and transmit to the SQM server via HTTP the metrics for CPU and memory KPIs of the network elements.

You can check this log to see if the missing file has been automatically exported. \n\n    Question:\n    What is the purpose of the lock file `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/voice_out.lock`?\n\n    Now give me your response to the question based on the context provided:\n     The lock file `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/voice_out.lock` serves as a mechanism to prevent multiple instances of the script from running concurrently. If the previous execution was forcefully stopped, this lock file would need to be deleted manually before re-executing the script.\n\n    Question:\n    How do I troubleshoot if 5 or more files weren't exported during the Location Mobility voiceOut export process?\n\n    Now give me your response to the question based on the context provided:\n     If 5 or more files weren't exported during the Location Mobility voiceOut export process, you should execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag. This will instruct the script to catch-up, meaning to export files for N 2-hour intervals.\n\n    Question:\n    What does it mean if the failed execution's log contains the message \"INFO: Nothing to export.\"?\n\n    Now give me your response to the question based on the context provided:\n     If the failed execution's log contains the message \"INFO: Nothing to export.\", it means that there is no new data available in the tables `sai.voice_raw_v` or `osix.osix_voice_raw`. As a result, there are no files to be exported during this execution. To resolve this issue, you should ensure that new data is loaded into these tables before re-executing the script.\n\n    Question:\n    How do I manually execute the Location Mobility voiceOut export script if some files were missed?\n\n    Now give me your response to the question based on the context provided:\n     Before manually executing the Location Mobility voiceOut export script, you should first check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log. If not, and 4 or less files were missed, the procedure will automatically catch up at the next execution. However, if 5 or more files were missed, you need to execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag to instruct the script to catch-up.\n\n    Question:\n    What should I do if the failed execution's log contains the message \"ERROR: Script is being executed by another process.

Exiting..\" and there are no running processes, it means that the previous execution was forcefully stopped. In this case, you should delete the lock file `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/voice_out.lock` and then execute the script again.\n\n    Question:\n    What does the filename format `LM_07_voiceOut_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt` represent in the Location Mobility voiceOut export process?\n\n    Now give me your response to the question based on the context provided:\n     The filename format `LM_07_voiceOut_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt` represents a specific file produced during the Location Mobility voiceOut export process. Here's what each part of the filename represents: \n- `LM_07_voiceOut`: This is a fixed prefix that identifies the type of data being exported, which in this case is related to voice out activities.\n- `yyyyMMdd`: This represents the date for which the data is being exported, formatted as year (4 digits), month (2 digits), and day (2 digits).\n- `xxx`: This is a serial number between `01` and `12`, indicating that up to 12 files can be produced for each 2-hour interval on a given date.\n\n    Question:\n    What should I do if the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded?\n\n    Now give me your response to the question based on the context provided:\n     If the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded, then you don't need to take any immediate action. The procedure is designed to automatically catch up with missed files during the next scheduled execution, as long as the necessary data has been loaded into the relevant tables.\n\n    Question:\n    What should I do if 5 or more files weren't exported during the Location Mobility voiceOut export process?\n\n    Now give me your response to the question based on the context provided:\n     If 5 or more files weren't exported during the Location Mobility voiceOut export process, you need to execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag.

At the same path there is the script `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` that loads the reference data from the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table to the `refdata.rd_cells` table, so that the two tables have the latest data recorded. These actions are handled by different server coordinators of cloudera manager. \nWe checked the log files for each month at the `/shared/abc/refdata/log` path to see which coordinator was responsible for these processes at September 12. After that we logged in Cloudera Manager, and checked the log files at the specific time interval. We found that due to synchronization issues , the coordinator that updated `refdata.rd_cells` updated it before the procedure that refreshed the data at  `refdata.rd_cells_load` so it read the data from the previous date.\nThe solution was to add the parameter **set SYNC_DDL=1** at the necessary scripts so there are no synchronization issues.\nThe logs at cloudera manager are deleted after a certain period of time, so they need to be checked soon after the ticket.\n### Hive Tables\n- Target Database: `refdata`\n- Target Tables: \n\t1. `rd_cells_load`\n\t1. `rd_services_load`\n\t1. `rd_crm_load`\n\t1. `rf_devices_load`\n| Table Name         | Description                      |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|\n| rd_cells_load      | Historical data of cell metadata |\n| rd_services_load   | Historical data of services      |\n| rd_crm_load        | Historical data of CRM records   |\n| rf_devices_load    | Historical data of device info   |\n## Data process\nHigh-level overview of how reference files are prepared, parsed, and loaded into historical and snapshot Hive tables.\n### High Level Overview\n![High_Level_Overview](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/alarm-archiving/refdata/-/raw/main/docs/ReferenceData.High_Level_Overview.png)\n##### Steps 1-3: \nabc is responsible for the preparation/creation of the Reference Data flat files.\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh crm 20220209\n```\nOnce the loads completed, the flat files renamed to <CURRENT_YYYYMMDD>.LOADED\n```\ncells_20220207.csv.20230531.LOADED\ncells_20220208.csv.20230531.LOADED\ncells_20220209.csv.20230531.LOADED\nservices_20220207.csv.20230531.LOADED\ndevices_20220208.csv.20230531.LOADED\ncrm_20220209.csv.20230531.LOADED\n```\n## Troubleshooting\nExplains how to identify and resolve issues with reference data loads using error logs and manual script execution.\n**Currently, the Reference Data flow does not support the `Monitoring` services.**  \n- An email will be sent by the system with the point of failure.\ni.e.\n```\nSubject: ALERT: Reference data Loading, Type:CELL,  File:cells_20220207.csv\nBody: \n\tReference Type  : CELL\n\tReference File  : cells_20220207.csv\n\tReference Scirpt: 210_refData_Load.sh\n\t------------------------------------------\n\tERROR:$(date '+%F %T'), ALTER TABLE or LOAD DATA command failed.\n```\n- Check the log files for errors/exceptions\n---\ntitle: Hive2Script Job Failure - Corrupt Parquet File in osix.sip Partition\ndescription: Resolution of failed Hive2Script Oozie job in abc BigStreamer due to corrupt Parquet file in osix.sip partition (par_dt=20201123, par_hr=08); includes file inspection, fsck, and table refresh commands.\ntags:\n  - bigstreamer\n  - abc\n  - hive2script\n  - hive\n  - impala\n  - spark\n  - oozie\n  - parquet\n  - corrupted-parquet\n  - fsck\n  - metadata\n  - partition-refresh\n  - stale-metadata\n  - osix\n  - osix.sip\n  - hdfs\n  - application_failure\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  cluster: abc\n  issue_id: IM1364500\n  table: osix.sip\n  affected_partition:\n    par_dt: \"20201123\"\n    par_hr: \"08\"\n  error:\n    message: File has an invalid version number\n    cause: Corrupt Parquet file\n  nodes:\n    - unosix1.bigdata.abc.gr\n    - sn87.bigdata.abc.gr\n    - un2.bigdata.abc.gr\n  tools:\n    - parquet-tools\n    - hdfs fsck\n    - impala-shell\n    - yarn logs\n    - hive\n    - oozie\n    - spark\n    - kinit\n  corrupt_files:\n    - part-00006-17ead666-d5cb-437e-a849-c08ef825bec4.c000\n  commands_executed:\n    - REFRESH osix.sip PARTITION\n    - parquet-tools meta\n    - hdfs dfs -mv\n---\n# abc - BigStreamer - IM1364500 - abc BigStreamer oozie job hive2script failed / stale metadata\n## Description\nImpala queries finish with error for table osix.sip and partition 20201123\nMessage:\nERROR processing query/statement.

If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nnamespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\n### Apply service account and role binding\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\n### Generate user kubeconfig using plugin:\ninstallation, completion can be enabled by executing:\n```bash\nmkdir -p /etc/bash_completion.d\nkubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl\n```\nIf possible a nice to have plugin for setting up kubeconfigs can be found at\n[kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin](https://github.com/superbrothers/kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin/releases). Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the [instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing the following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\ncp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. Edit the file /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config and replace the values of client-certificate-data and client-key-data with the ones copied from /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf.\nin order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n```bash\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n```bash\nkubectl get pods\n```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n---\ntitle: RAN.AI Airflow Scheduler Failure Due to Longhorn PVC Issue\ndescription: Investigation and resolution of a pod failure in the RAN.AI Kubernetes namespace caused by stuck Longhorn PVC replicas, leading to `airflow-scheduler` entering CrashLoopBackOff state and failing to mount volumes.

Log events showed repeated errors related to mounting the `logs` volume, with specific references to device formatting failures (e.g., `mke2fs exit status 1`) and timeouts in the Kubernetes event log.\nDespite restarting the pod, it remained in an `Init:0/1` state. Investigations using `kubectl`, Longhorn UI, and `kubemaster` logs revealed that three PVC replicas were stuck in a deleting state, which blocked the volume from attaching correctly. This indicated a storage issue potentially linked to a bug in the Longhorn engine.\nThe airflow scheduler is down due to access rights in the logs folder.\npod airflow-scheduler-0 had entered a restart loop as shown below.\n```bash\nroot@kubemaster1:~# kubectl get pods -n ranai-geo\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nairflow-postgresql-0 1/1 Running 0 326d\nairflow-scheduler-0 0/2

again.\nLogs and events after pod restart are attached.\n```bash\nroot@kubemaster1:~# kubectl get pods -n ranai-geo\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nairflow-postgresql-0 1/1 Running 0

initialization.\ncmd: `kubectl describe <airflow-scheduler-pod> -n ranai-geo`\n![error_mount](.media/mounterror.JPG)\nConfigmap Mounting Issues: Further examination of the pod's logs and configuration revealed that some required configmaps were failing to mount correctly, causing a disruption in the pod initialization process.\nIdentify the airflow pv:\n![pv](.media/getpv.JPG)\n`kubectl logs instance-manager-r-28535c55 -n instance-manager-r`\nPVC logs:\n![pvclogs1](.media/pvc1logs.JPG)\n![pvclogs2](.media/pvc2logs.JPG)\n![pvclogs3](.media/pv3logs.JPG)\n## Root Cause Analysis\nTo investigate possible underlying storage issues, we accessed [Longhorn](https://kubemaster-vip.bigdata.abc.gr/longhorn/) and discovered that the PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) associated with the airflow-scheduler had three replicas of airflow-scheduler pvc stuck in a deleting state.\n![longhornUI](.media/longhornbug.JPG)\n## Resolution\nTo resolve the issue and restore the airflow-scheduler pod's functionality, the following steps were taken:\n### Deletion of Problematic PVC\nThe three problematic replicas of airflow-scheduler PVC in Longhorn, which were stuck in a deleting state, were the problem, as a result we deleted the airflow's PVC.\nNfgh: It is important to mention that this issue might be related to a bug within the Longhorn storage system, as it caused replicated PVCs to get stuck in a deleting state. Further investigation and monitoring of Longhorn may be necessary to prevent such issues from recurring. Also see this [thread](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4278)\n## Actions Taken\nDeleted problematic PVCs in Longhorn under instance-manager-r namespace.\n`kubectl delete pvc pvc-c826d577-e764-470e-9904-3986042810aa -n ranai-geo`\n## Recommendations\nMonitor Longhorn for any recurring issues with PVC management to prevent similar incidents.\n**Pod Script:** `/app/run_vdsl2.sh`  \n**Main Configuration File:** `/app/conf/application.yaml`  \n**Logs:** Use `kubectl logs` to view `stdout`  \n**Hadoop Table:** `bigcust.vdsl2`\n## Application Components\n### SNMP Polling of Elements\nThis step performs SNMP polling on VDSL2 network elements to collect performance metrics, storing the raw output files inside the pod.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Piraeus Bank VTUs] -->|SNMP Polling| B[File: nnmcp.vdsl-g*.\\*.txt <br> Path: /app/work/data <br> Pod ]\n```\nThe application polls data using SNMP. The raw files produced, contain component metrics ([4 metrics](#metrics) for each Element) of the network elements and are stored in local path inside a Kubernetes pod.\n**Output Path Configuration:** `/app/conf/application.yaml` -> `snmppoller.dataDir`  \n**Output File Name Pattern:** `nnmcp.vdsl-g*.\\*.txt`  \n**Elements Configuration File:** `/app/conf/application.yaml` -> `snmppoller.endpoints`\n## Step 4: Recommission the Node in Cloudera Manager\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might fail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\nAfter everything is back online the kudu tablet on the host might not have taken on any tablets. This\nis normal as all tablets have been replicated to the other hosts. With time it will take on tablets as\nwell.\nThis can be verified using `ksck` as the kudu user.",

We also noticed problems with geolocation streams and loc mob files.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Connect with personal creds `https://172.25.37.232:7183` Cloudera Manager\n2. Both Namenodes entered standby mode simultaneously which caused bad health on HDFS,HBASE,OOZIE,IMPALA. After nn1 restarted nn2 became the Active and nn1 the Standby namenode. All the other services was stable after this manual action except HBASE which restarted.\n> The dual-standby state of both Namenodes caused a loss of HDFS coordination, which cascaded failures to other dependent services like HBase, Oozie, and Impala. After restarting nn1, high availability was restored with nn2 becoming active.\n3. Since all services were stable check HUE `https://172.25.37.236:8888/oozie/list_oozie_workflows/` to ensure that all workflows running.\n4.

Execute steps 1-5 from [this doc](knowledge-base/abc/BigStreamer/20201125-IM1363226.md)\n2. After the check we saw that table `brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist` had no data for 20210119 and 20210120, even though upstream tables were populated.\n```bash\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20210115'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\nResult:\ncount(*)\tpar_dt\t\n...\n2491814\t20210117\t\n2491872\t20210118\t\n2494261\t20210121\t\n...\n```\n3. Check coordinator `coord_brond_load_dsl_daily_stats` that populates this table as explained in [here](systems-info/abc/BigStreamer/Brond/cube_indicators_pipeline.md). \n4. Check that source tables `brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week` and `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week` have data for these partitions. Same query for `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week`\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week\nwhere par_dt >= '20210115'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\nResult:\ncount(*)\tpar_dt\t\n...\n1806006\t20210116\t\n1806256\t20210117\t\n1806306\t20210118\t\n1808049\t20210119\t\n1808918\t20210120\t\n1810234\t20210121\t\n1811401\t20210122\t\n```\nAs source tables have data, we have to execute only the missing inserts for the affected partitions.\n> Since both ADSL and VDSL source tables contained data for `20210119` and `20210120`, the issue is isolated to the execution of the DSL stats coordinator.\n5. Impala insert queries are under `/user/intra/brond_dsl_stats/impala-shell/populate*.sql`. Change conditions `..par_dt > '20210127..` to get the dates that are missing. In this case `20210119`. Execute the queries using Hue or impala-shell.\n6. Repeat step 2 to validate that data are loaded correctly for missing dates.\n7.

Identify Missing Data in brond.cube_indicators. Since 3 dates are missing 2020/11/20-22, we need to run the workflow that populates `brond.cube_indicators`. But first we have to make sure all its table dependecies are loaded. Execute the following queries in an impala-shell or an Impala editor in Hue and make sure not only that partitions exist for those dates but also that there are an identical amount of lines.\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_retrains_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20201118'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\n...\ncount(*),par_dt\n2499833,20201118\n2497948,20201119\n*2496522,20201120*\n*2497810,20201121*\n*2497480,20201122*\n2496932,20201123\n2497130,20201124\n2505791,20201125\n``` \nExecute the same query for tables:\n- brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp\n- brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq\n- radius.radacct_hist\n- brond.brond_retrains_hist\n- brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nThis confirms the root cause: the brond.cube_indicators table lacked data for these dates, resulting in empty CSI_fix exports.\n6. Rerun Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators for Missing Partitions. Run Cube_Indicators workflow. Login to Hue as intra and navigate to Workflows > Dashboards > Coordinators. Search for `Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators` and click on the coordinator to view its executions. Select **one** at a time of the executions that need to be repeated. Nfgh that `brond.cube_indicators` is populated with a 2 day delay so if we want to load data for 2020-11-20 we have to execute the workflow of 2020-11-22. Select the execution from the check box and click `Rerun`. \n7. After each workflow execution repeat the query of step 4 to verify that table has been loaded. \n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2454321,20201120\n2458393,20201123\n```\n8. Gather dates that need to be exported. As we saw in step 5 the source table was empty for 3 partitions: 20201120, 20201121, 20201122. The files produced for them was empty. Verify by checking `/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log`:\n```bash\n2020-11-21 09:01:39  CSI_fix_11212020_w47.txt  20201119  2453089\n2020-11-22 09:00:43  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  0\n2020-11-23 09:28:14  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  0\n2020-11-24 09:01:01  CSI_fix_11242020_w47.txt  20201122  0\n2020-11-25 09:03:13  CSI_fix_11252020_w48.txt  20201123  2458393\n```\n*CSI fix* provides a mechanism to avoid manual re-export of empty files. The most recent date of an empty file is stored in a table and automatically exported with the next execution. To view the date stored issue the query:\n```bash\nselect * from refdata.mediation_csi_load_info;\n...\nload_time,flow_name\nNULL,sai.mob\n20201122,sai.fix\n```\nSo we don't need to export manually date 20201122, only dates 20201120 & 20201121.\n9. Manually Export CSI_fix Files Using export_csi_fix.sh. Finally, to export the files we have to repeat step 1 and execute the export script **sequentially** for the desired dates + 2 days:\n```bash\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201122 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201123 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n```\nThis confirms the missing CSI_fix files were regenerated successfully with the expected number of lines.\n10. Afterwards check the reconciliation log file that files have been exported:\n```bash\nless /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log\n...\n2020-11-25 10:46:40  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  4915294\n2020-11-25 10:51:17  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  2457858\n```\nThe first one contains more lines as it includes dates 20201120 & 20201122.\n## Affected Systems\nabc Bigstreamer Backend\n---\ntitle: \"Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\"\ndescription: \"Instructions for manually executing the Cube Indicators Spark job from terminal on un1.bigdata.abc.gr, including how to pull the latest script, modify execution date, and run the submit script.\"\ntags:\n  - cube indicators\n  - spark job\n  - pyspark\n  - hdfs\n  - brond\n  - manual execution\n  - terminal\n  - big data\n  - intra\n---\n# Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\nThis guide explains how to manually run the Cube Indicators Spark job for missing dates from the terminal.

This morning we reset the user's password because it had expired. It can connect normally with the credentials. Also let me know that the applications of the other users (Charisis, Ploskas) are running normally.\n## Actions Taken\n### 1. Validate LDAP Bind Account (t1-svc-cnebind)\n- Ssh to **unrstudio1**\n- Do an ldap search using `t1-svc-cnebind` as the following in order to check if `t1-svc-cnebind` password is still valid:\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=t1-svc-cnebind)'\n```\n-  In the above case, if you get an error that you can't connect with the ldap server, that means it has an expired `t1-svc-cnebind` password, so you will need to replace it with a new one.\n### 2. Update LDAP Bind Password in RStudio Connect Config\n- Check the configuration file below for the current ldap t1-svc-cnebind password & replace it with new **(Responsible for that abc Admin)**:\n```bash\nssh unrstudio1\nvi /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg\n```\n### Conclusion\nRStudio Connect applications for user `kmpoletis` failed due to expired `t1-svc-cnebind` LDAP credentials. Issue resolved by updating the bind password in the system configuration file. Other users remained unaffected.\nUse `slapcat` to export the current config and data for recovery purposes.\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif\nslapcat -n 2 -l data.ldif\n```\n## Step 6: Apply Password Changes\nUse `ldapmodify` with the generated LDIF files to apply the password change.\n```bash\nldapmodify -H ldapi:// -Y EXTERNAL -f changepwmanager.ldif\nldapmodify -H ldapi:// -Y EXTERNAL -f changepwconfig.ldif\n```\n## Step 7: Validate the New Password\nTest that the new Manager password works both via CLI and web UI on `kerb1` and `kerb2`.\n### 7a. Command-Line Verification\nFor `kerb1`. Where `uid` add a ldap user. e.g your ldap username:\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=xxxx'\n```\nFor `kerb2`. Where `uid` add a ldap user. e.g your ldap username::\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=xxxx'\n```\n### 7b.

The procedure involves log review on the ingestion and source systems (un2 and nnmprd01) and CSV generation verification.\n# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\n# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n- Connect to `un2` as `ipvpn` and inspect the log file:\n```bash\nssh root@un2\nsu ipvpn\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException (Impala Query Returned No Data)\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException (Transformation Failure)\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMAuthException (Token Auth Failure)\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException (SQM Ingestion Failure)\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException (Schema Mismatch)\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n# Support\nWhere to check system health (Grafana, MySQL), common exceptions and their causes, and support scripts.\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Visual Dashboards (Grafana)\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DataBase (MySQL)\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.\n## SQM Token Authentication\nThe authentication on the SQM server is done with the HTTP Token Auth in IPVPN-SM application. It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n# Failure Handling\nHow to debug failed requests, interpret logs, and what to check first when something breaks.\n## Logs\n### Failure Log Locations\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support",

We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n```\nNow replication works.\n### Re-enable SPN Preauthentication (Post-Migration Cleanup)\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\nmanagedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n```\n`krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

The crash was caused by an `OutOfMemoryError`, due to the default Java heap size being set too low (512MB).\nThe following health issue has occurred in the cloudera manager system:\n```\nSpark on yarn - History Server (dr1node03) - Unexpected Exits\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for DR Site\n2. We inspected logs for this role for the time that the problem arose: `Cloudera > Diagnostics > Logs` and chose `Service: Spark on Yarn` and `Role: History Server`. We could not identify the root cause by these logs\n3. ssh to dr1node03 as root, went to `/var/run/process` , and inspected logs from the process that ran at the time of the problem and found out that the process with pid 51291 was killed while a `OutOfMemoryError` occured\n![terminal_screenshot](.media/IM2098517/spark_on_yarn.png)\n### Resolution\n4. We checked the  `java heap size` of the History Server through Cloudera UI configuration tab. It was set to 512M.\n5. We checked the respective option for the PR Site and it was set to 2G\n6. We set the `java heap size` of the History Server to 2G at the DR Site\n7. We proceeded to restart of the role after communication with the customer\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n07/03/23 16:28:55 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nWe have restarted the History Server after a phone call. There was no problem during the restart.\nThank you\n07/03/23 16:21:21 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe exit occurred due to an out of memory error. We have changed the java heap size of the History Server from 512MB to 2GB as in the PR. We will need to restart the role. There will be no outage.\n```\n---\ntitle: HiveServer2 OutOfMemory Crash on dr1node04 Due to Large Queries on pmnt_response_stg_0\ndescription: HiveServer2 on dr1node04 crashed with OutOfMemory errors after executing multiple large queries on dev_trlog_card.pmnt_response_stg_0; identified via JVM heap/GC logs and Cloudera monitoring charts, then resolved by service restart.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - hiveserver2\n  - dr1node04\n  - outofmemory\n  - java heap space\n  - garbage collector\n  - pause duration\n  - cloudera manager\n  - jvm heap\n  - gc logs\n  - dev_trlog_card\n  - pmnt_response_stg_0\n  - query failure\n  - yarn\n  - application timeout\n  - hive crash\n  - im2024442\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2024442\n  system: mno BigStreamer DR1 HiveServer2\n  root_cause: Multiple concurrent heavy queries caused Java heap saturation in HiveServer2, leading to long GC pauses and service crash\n  resolution_summary: HiveServer2 on dr1node04 was restarted and returned to normal operation; queries from E30825 and E36254 on pmnt_response_stg_0 table identified as root cause\n  affected_component: HiveServer2\n  crashing_queries:\n    - application_1665578283516_50081\n    - application_1665578283516_50084\n    - application_1665578283516_50085\n    - application_1665578283516_50088\n    - application_1665578283516_50089\n    - application_1665578283516_50090\n    - application_1665578283516_50095\n    - application_1665578283516_50096\n  affected_table: dev_trlog_card.pmnt_response_stg_0\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2024442 - Critical alarm in Cloudera Application - dr1edge01\n## Description\nA critical alarm appeared in Cloudera Application in dr1edge01.\nHive --> HiveServer2 (dr1node04) // Pause Duration.\n## Actions Taken\n1.

The issue stems from physical user workloads (queries, jobs) monopolizing critical system resources\u2014specifically on `dr1node03` where MySQL is hosted. This results in Spark topologies entering a stalled state due to delayed authorization responses from the overloaded MySQL service.\nThe following alert appeared in the grafana system:\n```\n[DR][IBANK] Spark Waiting Batches Alert\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. The following text has been sent to mno/PM and explains the problem, as well as the recommended actions:\n```text\nSpark Waiting Batches Problem: The first and most important problem we have is the \"Spark Waiting Batches\" which opens a ticket for this monitoring. This is due to physical user actions (queries/jobs) that occupy/bind production resources on the disaster site mainly. This results in there being no resources available for the MySQL process (a central point that the entire cluster has a dependency on), the service that does the authorization is unable to process its data in the database and thus causes a delay in the spark topologies until the \"permission denied\" error is resolved. The spark topologies, while up and running, are unable to process the data, as a result of which they continue to execute after the execution of the jobs that occupied the resources on the server where the MySQL service is located has finished. We do not take any action in this nor can we do anything and mno has asked us to close the ticket directly.\nSuggestion: Disable Impala Daemon and YARN Node Manager on dr1node03.mno.gr, pr1node03.mno.gr where the primary MySQL service is located. This will not affect our cluster workload as, as you will see in the attached screenshots:\n1. impala_mean.png: The average memory occupied by Impala Daemon is much smaller than the limit (150GB) that we have set even in the evening hours when all the flows \"close\" the previous day and the largest load is concentrated on the cluster.\n```\n![impala mean usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_mean.PNG)\n``` text\n2. impala_total.png: The total memory commitment from Impala cumulatively for all nodes is at its peak about 500GB less than the total available, which means that by removing a node there will still be room for resources even with the addition of new flows\n```\n![impala total usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_total.PNG)\n```\n3. yarn.png: throughout the day, the available yarn resources are sufficient even with the removal of more than one node\nThe above applies to both sites and the screenshots are from the Disaster site, where the most resources are reserved compared to the 2 sites. It is important as in this MySQL has a dependency on the entire cluster.\n```\n![yarn usage](.media/IM2099957/yarn.PNG)\n``` text\nBy monitoring the remaining nodes of the 2 clusters, we see how they can manage the workload at CPU levels and with the above proposal we will reduce the CPU levels on critical node03 which anyway uses increased CPU for cluster management processes.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nmno Disaster Site\n## Action Points\n- [Issue 66 \u2013 Resource contention on MySQL node (Disable roles)](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/66)  \n- [Issue 196 \u2013 Cluster role optimization for Spark performance](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/196)\n---\ntitle: Spark Waiting Batches Alert on DR Online Topology Due to Kerberos Failure\ndescription: Spark Waiting Batches alert triggered on DR Online topology due to Kerberos authentication failure caused by domain controller downtime; topology was resubmitted and affected data was restored via distcp.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - spark\n  - spark waiting batches\n  - online topology\n  - kerberos\n  - grafana\n  - prodrest\n  - dr1edge01\n  - hbase\n  - kudu\n  - distcp\n  - yarn\n  - cluster monitoring\n  - ticket im2165930\n  - sd2228613\n  - authentication error\n  - domain controller\n  - merge batch\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2165930\n  related_issue: SD2228613\n  system: mno BigStreamer DR Site\n  root_cause: Spark Streaming job failed due to Kerberos errors caused by domain controller being down for patching\n  resolution_summary: Resubmitted Spark topology, avoided duplicate merge batch inserts by transferring Hive data from PR via distcp and cleaning Kudu manually\n  affected_components:\n    - Spark Streaming Online\n    - Kerberos\n    - prod_trlog_online.service_audit\n    - DR Site Merge Batch\n  remediation_actions:\n    - Resubmitted topology\n    - Avoided duplicate inserts\n    - Manual Kudu cleanup\n    - Verified HBase cleared via CleanupHBaseSAS\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2165930 - Alert at Grafana\n## Description\nA Spark Waiting Batches alert was triggered on the DR Online topology due to a Kerberos failure caused by a domain controller outage.

The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG.

From `Charts>Impala Perf` we noticed increased resource commitment through Impala Pool Reserved and Threads charts.\n![Impala Pool Reserved](.media/Impala_pool_reserved.PNG)\n![Threads](.media/threads.PNG)\n4. From `Cloudera Manager>Impala>Queries` we searched for queries that took place at the time the problem raised. We found that the query with ID 6d44d9525a681fb8:5e536ffc00000000 had Threads:CPU Time 10.7h. Upon inspection through `Query Details` we saw that the query was of high complexity with conversions and comparisons with regex.\n![Query](.media/query.PNG)\n5.

Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account and confirm that Datawarehouse Flows have failed from `Monitoring/Monitoring PR/DR` dashboard.\n2. All flows have failed with `Code: 6` which means that the control script has timed-out while monitoring the `EXTRACT` script. The `EXTRACT` step has 2 sub-steps: `Impala Insert` and `Sqoop Export`.\n3. Check logs:\nFrom `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:\n``` bash\nless /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log\n```\nIn this file for all flows that failed we see that the last log entry is the submission of the `Impala Insert` part of the `EXTRACT`, which was still running. This means that another query is hogging all resources for Impala and our flows are waiting to be executed.\n4. Login to Disaster Site Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.mno.gr:7183` and check for resource intensive Impala queries `Clusters > Impala > Queries`. The key resource here is memory as this is the only metric that can be defined in Resource Pools.\nThe query that created the problem was `COMPUTE STATS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`. Pictures are not included because Impala does not report statistics for the `COMPUTE STATS` queries, but given the size of the table and the time of execution it matched. This hypothesis was later confirmed when the same problem appeared on a later `COMPUTE STATS` execution.\n5. We informed the customer to re-run the failed jobs and proposed to stop computing statistics for that table as they did not impact our application.\n``` text\n27/10/22 13:16:01 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nPlease rerun the flow steps that encountered a problem.\nWe are continuing to investigate the root cause of the problem.\n**Workaround**\n27/10/22 13:32:44 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nFollowing the previous answer, the compute statistics on the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table committed many resources on the Calatog Server and the query Coordinator (dr1node02), resulting in REFRESH/INVALIDATE METADATA operations experiencing long execution times and causing jobs to time out. After the compute statistics were completed, Impala released the resources and resumed.\nAs we have communicated in the past, from our perspective the statistics of the table are not necessary. Please let us know if we can disable the production of statistics for this particular table.\n**Resolved**\n```\n6.

It correctly states that the failure was due to a timeout in the control script while waiting for the EXTRACT phase to finish. This, in turn, was caused by Impala resource saturation resulting from a COMPUTE STATS operation on a large table.\n\nThe response also provides appropriate recommendations to avoid this issue in the future. These include monitoring Impala resource utilization and adjusting the COMPUTE STATS schedule accordingly to prevent resource contention. Additionally, implementing a retry mechanism for the EXPORT job can help handle temporary failures due to resource saturation.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the chatbot response is overly verbose and repetitive. The same information and recommendations are presented multiple times in slightly different wording.

At the YARN UI search for `PRODUSER`, sort by End date and search with \"PROD_IBANK_DWH_EXPORT_ServiceAudit. You will find the failed application.\n4. From the UI we noticed that the job with id application_1651064786946_8294 started manually before the completion of the automated job with id application_1651064786946_8190, which led to the failure of the second job.\n5. We informed the client that they should rerun the failed job manually from the scheduler after the completion of the manual step. Also, we pointed out that before proceding with manual actions they should make sure beforehand that all scheduled flows have completed.\nA review of the application_ids on YARN revealed that application_1651064786946_8294 was launched manually before the completion of the automated scheduled job application_1651064786946_8190, resulting in a resource conflict and batch job failure.\nWe advised the client to avoid overlapping manual executions with scheduler runs to prevent such conflicts in the future.\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster Site IBank Batch\n- The export job will not be executed if the previous day is not a business day\n- The script cleans up after failure, so if the problem was temporary **communicate with mno UC4 administrators to rerun the job if you fixed the problem.

We found that the query with ID 6d44d9525a681fb8:5e536ffc00000000 had Threads:CPU Time 10.7h. Upon inspection through `Query Details` we saw that the query was of high complexity with conversions and comparisons with regex.\n![Query](.media/query.PNG)\n5.

The issue stems from physical user workloads (queries, jobs) monopolizing critical system resources\u2014specifically on `dr1node03` where MySQL is hosted. This results in Spark topologies entering a stalled state due to delayed authorization responses from the overloaded MySQL service.\nThe following alert appeared in the grafana system:\n```\n[DR][IBANK] Spark Waiting Batches Alert\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. The following text has been sent to mno/PM and explains the problem, as well as the recommended actions:\n```text\nSpark Waiting Batches Problem: The first and most important problem we have is the \"Spark Waiting Batches\" which opens a ticket for this monitoring. This is due to physical user actions (queries/jobs) that occupy/bind production resources on the disaster site mainly. This results in there being no resources available for the MySQL process (a central point that the entire cluster has a dependency on), the service that does the authorization is unable to process its data in the database and thus causes a delay in the spark topologies until the \"permission denied\" error is resolved. The spark topologies, while up and running, are unable to process the data, as a result of which they continue to execute after the execution of the jobs that occupied the resources on the server where the MySQL service is located has finished. We do not take any action in this nor can we do anything and mno has asked us to close the ticket directly.\nSuggestion: Disable Impala Daemon and YARN Node Manager on dr1node03.mno.gr, pr1node03.mno.gr where the primary MySQL service is located. This will not affect our cluster workload as, as you will see in the attached screenshots:\n1. impala_mean.png: The average memory occupied by Impala Daemon is much smaller than the limit (150GB) that we have set even in the evening hours when all the flows \"close\" the previous day and the largest load is concentrated on the cluster.\n```\n![impala mean usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_mean.PNG)\n``` text\n2. impala_total.png: The total memory commitment from Impala cumulatively for all nodes is at its peak about 500GB less than the total available, which means that by removing a node there will still be room for resources even with the addition of new flows\n```\n![impala total usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_total.PNG)\n```\n3. yarn.png: throughout the day, the available yarn resources are sufficient even with the removal of more than one node\nThe above applies to both sites and the screenshots are from the Disaster site, where the most resources are reserved compared to the 2 sites. It is important as in this MySQL has a dependency on the entire cluster.\n```\n![yarn usage](.media/IM2099957/yarn.PNG)\n``` text\nBy monitoring the remaining nodes of the 2 clusters, we see how they can manage the workload at CPU levels and with the above proposal we will reduce the CPU levels on critical node03 which anyway uses increased CPU for cluster management processes.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nmno Disaster Site\n## Action Points\n- [Issue 66 \u2013 Resource contention on MySQL node (Disable roles)](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/66)  \n- [Issue 196 \u2013 Cluster role optimization for Spark performance](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/196)\n---\ntitle: Impala Connection Pool Exhaustion During HBase Upsert Job Due to Serial Execution on Coordinator\ndescription: The Impala daemon (pr1node04) was overloaded during execution of the Upsert to HBase stage for the IBANK Visible table due to forced single-node execution, resulting in blocked queries, high concurrent connections, and system health alerts; resolved by reverting script changes and disabling HBase quotas.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - impala\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala client connections\n  - impala coordinator\n  - hbase\n  - hbase quotas\n  - upsert to hbase\n  - ibank visible\n  - prodrest\n  - spark\n  - concurrency\n  - impala query failure\n  - cloudera manager\n  - pr1node04\n  - pr1node01\n  - resource bottleneck\n  - impala query logs\n  - impala role restart\n  - IM2097021\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2097021\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: Forced single-node execution of an Impala upsert query exhausted coordinator (pr1node04), blocking concurrent queries and triggering health alerts\n  resolution_summary: Cancelled the long-running query, restarted Impala daemons, removed serial execution flag, and reran the job with parallel execution enabled\n  affected_daemons:\n    - pr1node01\n    - pr1node04\n  related_jobs:\n    - /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh\n  customer_impact: live stream ingestion and production queries were stalled\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2097021 - Multiple Health issues on PR Impala\n## Description\nOn 02/03/2023 at 23:30, multiple Impala daemons across PR Site triggered health alerts in Cloudera Manager due to high concurrent client connections and pause duration warnings. The issue originated from a long-running query used in the IBANK Visible table upsert job, which was executed in single-node mode (via `set num_nodes = 1`). This forced the query to overload the coordinator daemon (pr1node04), which caused query blocking, client connection accumulation, and stalled streaming services.\nToday 02/03/2023 & 23:30 the Following alarms appeared on Cloudera:\n```\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node01)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node02)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node03)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node04)]\n[Pause Duration]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node05)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node06)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site \n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\n![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\n> Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well.\n### Mitigation\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\n1st way: From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\n2nd way: From the url that we monitor the query.\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond.\n### Resolution\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality.\n7. Upon investigation, we concluded that the change to `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` that stops the parallel execution of the query by Impala daemons (set num_nodes = 1) was the cause of the problem.\n8. We scheduled to rerun the `Upsert to HBase` stage the following day after reverting the script to use all Impala daemons for parallel execution.\n### Long-Term Fix\n9.  On 03/03/2023 \n- we disabled HBase quotas for ` PROD_IBANK` namespace on PR Site according to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/22263_mno_HBASE_TUNING.docx) MoP\n- we removed `set num_nodes = 1` from `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`\n- reran the script\n10. The script ran successfully\n## Action Points\n1. We opened [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/67) issue to investigate and deploy a permanent fix for running `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` alongside HBase quotas.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 00:49:29 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe root cause is the same as ticket SD2158913.

Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped\n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\n# Replace haproxy node certificate with newly signed one\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone\n```\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` bash\ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```bash\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\nThis section explains how to verify unsigned and signed certificates for Cloudera and edge nodes using OpenSSL. Ensures certificate integrity before replacement.\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command: \n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\nand replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`.\nFor example:\n```bash\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has sent to us.\nAll procedures pertain to PR and DR edge nodes, except the RPM repository creation\nwhich is performed on pr1node1:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n## Step 1: Put Node in Standby and Stop Services\nStandby and backup steps before upgrading PostgreSQL on BigStreamer edge nodes.\nBefore continuing with the changes it is best to put the edge node you are\nworking on in standby mode, so as to not disrupt services:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\nStop the running postgres service:\n```bash\n# sudo -iu postgres\n$ systemctl stop postgresql-9.5.service\n$ systemctl disable postgresql-9-5.service\n$ systemctl status postgresql-9.5.service\n```\nBackup data on each edge server:\n```\n#### JKS certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\n# Import signed certificate into Cloudera's Java Keystore (JKS) on internal nodes\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n## Preparation\nBefore continuing with the changes it is best to put the edge node you are\nworking on in standby mode, so as to not disrupt services:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n## Step 1: Harden Apache httpd SSL Configuration\nEnforce TLSv1.2 and disable weak ciphers in Apache httpd.\nBackup the old httpd configs:\n```bash\n# cp -ap /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf  \"/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n# cp -ap /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  \"/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n# cp -ap /etc/httpd/conf.d/graphite-web.conf \"/etc/httpd/conf.d/graphite-web.conf.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n```\nAdd the following line in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`:\n```\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep DEVREST\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\nCovers how to copy, import, and activate the new signed certificates across all cluster nodes.\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\nFrom node01:\n#### Node certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n#### JKS certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\n---\ntitle: Kubernetes Certificate Renewal Procedure\ndescription: Yearly renewal process for expiring Kubernetes certificates on kubemaster1, kubemaster2, and kubemaster3 including backup, kubeadm certs renewal, and container restarts.\ntags: [kubernetes, certificates, renewal, kubeadm, kubemaster, static pods, downtime, cluster-admin, tls]\ncategory: infrastructure\nproduct: BigStreamer\nplatform: kubernetes\nconfidentiality: internal\n---\n# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Create and Pre-Split HBase Table\nThis section creates the usertable using pre-splitting to distribute load evenly across regionservers.\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n```bash\nhbase shell\nn_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n```bash\nbin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_read_quotas.dat\n```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n```bash\nhbase shell\ndisable 'quotas_test:usertable'\ndrop 'quotas_test:usertable'\nexists 'quotas_test:usertable'\nn_splits = 300\ncreate 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n```\n## Switch from Read to Write Quotas\nRemove read quotas and apply write quotas to the same namespace for comparative benchmarking.\n- Remove read quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\nlist_quotas\n```\n- Set write quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => WRITE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\ncommands:\n    - hbase shell\n    - kinit\n    - Cloudera Safety Valve\n---\n# Manage HBase Quotas\nThis document describes how to manage HBase quotas in the BigStreamer environment. It explains how to enable HBase throttling via Cloudera Manager, configure namespace-specific read and write request limits using the HBase shell, and cleanly remove quotas when no longer needed. Steps include using kinit, navigating HBase processes, and verifying changes through list_quotas.\n## Step 1: Enable Global HBase Quotas via Cloudera Manager\n1.

We checked the `CM` and all the services now is healthy.\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThis problem occurred due to `nfs` unavaliability.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\nThe issue was caused by the nfs storage used on the nodes of both clusters becoming full. This resulted in the host monitor of the cloudera management services timeouting as it was unable to collect metrics for each filesystem of the nodes.\nRelevant screenshots are attached showing the above causes of the issue.\nThroughout the issue, the flows were up and running as seen in grafana as it was a malfunction of the management services resulting in the incorrect image of all services in Cloudera Manager PR & DR respectively.\nAfter space was freed up on the nfs, both clusters returned to good health.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster/Primary Site\n---\ntitle: HDFS Block Count Alert on dr1node09 Due to service_audit_old Table Fragmentation\ndescription: An HDFS alert was triggered on the Disaster Site due to an excessive number of blocks on dr1node09 caused by unmanaged historical partitions in the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old table.

Login to `dr1edge01` with your personal account and execute `firefox` to view the Namenode UI.\n4. Go to `https://dr1node02.mno.gr:50470` and from there in the tab `Datanodes`. Order the datanodes using the block count by desceding order to overview the situation.\n5. Change user to PRODREST and use HDFS command or Impala query to check how many partitions exist in `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. This is a big table that has no retention mechanism yet so its data are stored in many blocks. HDFS command is `hdfs dfs -ls /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old` and Impala query is `show partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. In either case observe how many `par_dt` directories exist.\n6. In our case there were at least 6 months in there so we informed mno. Sample customer notification:\n```text\nRegarding ticket SD1734269, the error shown in Cloudera Manager refers to a block count threshold exceeded on dr1node09 and is due to the increased number of blocks stored on the new nodes dr1node07-10. The impact on the datanode lies in the performance as the metadata for the blocks it has in memory does not fit.\nFrom the investigation we did in the HDFS data, we saw that there are many files in the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old table. Specifically, there is history in it from 01/03.\nBy keeping only recent data through a retention mechanism, the total block count in HDFS and on each datanode individually will be reduced.\nAs an immediate solution, we suggest deleting data older than 40 days, as has been done in the past. Consequently, it will not be possible to investigate problems that occurred older than 40 days.\nPlease let us know if you agree with the above and when you would like us to proceed with the immediate solution.\n```\nRecipients are `ZEVGAROPOULOU.GEORGIA@mno.gr,krekoukias.konst@mno.gr,papakostas.athanasios@mno.gr`. Add our team and kbikos in CC.\n5. When mno agreed to the immediate action, we informed the monitoring team to ignore alarms in Cloudera Manager of DR site regarding HDFS, Hive, Impala and YARN. Their email address is `csocmonitoringops@jkl-telecom.com`. Example mail:\n```\nWe will proceed with actions on the National Bank of Greece Disaster Site infrastructure.\nDuring this time, you will probably have alarms in the Cloudera Manager UI related mainly to the Health of HDFS, Hive, Impala, Yarn.\nThe work will start at 16:40 today. We will inform you after the work is completed.\n```\n8. When the time comes, login to Grafana and check charts of topologies running in DR. Login to Cloudera Manager and check throughout the process the health status of Cloudera services. Ndef that `Hive Metastore Canary` alerts will pop up as expected.\n9. Login to dr1edge01 with your personal account and change user to `PRODREST`.\n10. Open an impala shell on DR:`impala-shell -i pr1edge.mno.gr -k --ssl`.\n11. Change database to `prod_trlog_ibank` with `use prod_trlog_ibank;` and `show tables;` to check that `service_audit_old` is here.\n12. Drop partitions. Seperate the amount of days you have to delete in batches of 15 days in order to avoid disruptions of applications. `ALTER TABLE service_audit_old DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION(par_dt<=20200715) PURGE;`\n12. When the query is done, execute the next one and so on: `ALTER TABLE service_audit_old DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION(par_dt<=20200801) PURGE;`\n13. Can't stress this enough. **Throughout steps 12, 13 check Grafana and Cloudera Manager**.\n14. When done, inform mno and the monitoring team that actions have been successfully finished.\n## Affected Systems\nmno Bigstreamer\n## Action Points\nDevelop retention mechanism to automatically drop old partitions.\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` bash\ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```bash\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\nThis section explains how to verify unsigned and signed certificates for Cloudera and edge nodes using OpenSSL. Ensures certificate integrity before replacement.\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command: \n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep DEVREST\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\nCovers how to copy, import, and activate the new signed certificates across all cluster nodes.\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\nFrom node01:\n#### Node certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n#### JKS certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\nUncomment line for `/dev/mapper/ol_pr1edge01-data_1 /data/1 xfs defaults 0 0` at `/etc/fstab`\n7.

The issue affects both historical and streaming tables, with warnings appearing due to out-of-date or missing metadata. It includes steps for HDFS size verification, reviewing Impala table stats, running `compute stats`, and `refresh`, as well as caveats for high-frequency streaming tables like `sai.sms_raw`.\nThe following tables have potentially corrupt table statistics. Drop and re-compute statistics to resolve this problem. ->\nsai.voice_quality_hist,\nsai.sms_raw, \nsai.voice_raw,\nbrond.brond_retrains_hist,\nbrond.td_dslam_week,\nookla.ookla_android,\nookla.ookla_ios,\nookla.ookla_stnet,\ntemip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms,\ntemip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms\n## Actions Taken\nTables like sai.sms_raw ingest data every 5 minutes, which makes real-time statistics invalid or misleading.\n### HDFS Table Size Check\nRun the following commands on un2 as user `intra` to inspect HDFS directory sizes of the affected tables:\n```bash\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/sai.db/voice_quality_hist\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/brond.db/brond_retrains_hist\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/brond.db/td_dslam_week\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_android\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_ios\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_stnet\n``` \n### Check Impala Table Stats\nReview current statistics for the affected tables via the Impala shell:\n```bash\nshow table stats  sai.voice_quality_hist               ;\nshow table stats  sai.sms_raw                          ;\nshow table stats  sai.voice_raw                        ;\nshow table stats  brond.brond_retrains_hist            ;\nshow table stats  brond.td_dslam_week                  ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_android                  ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_ios                      ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_stnet                    ;\nshow table stats  temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms ;\nshow table stats  temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms   ;\n```\n### Recompute Statistics\nExecute `compute stats` for the impacted tables. Note that for streaming tables, this may not be feasible during working hours:\n```bash\ncompute stats   sai.voice_quality_hist               ;\ncompute stats   sai.sms_raw                          ;\ncompute stats   sai.voice_raw                        ;\ncompute stats   brond.brond_retrains_hist            ;\ncompute stats   brond.td_dslam_week                  ;\ncompute stats   ookla.ookla_android                  ;\ncompute stats   ookla.ookla_ios                      ;\ncompute stats   ookla.ookla_stnet                    ;\ncompute stats   temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms ;\ncompute stats   temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms   ;\n```\n\u039dote: If there is a failure in any of the tables, run 'refresh' on this table.\n### Refresh Failing Tables\nUse `refresh` for any tables where `compute stats` fails due to corrupt metadata or loading conflicts:\n```bash\nrefresh   sai.voice_quality_hist               ;\nrefresh   sai.sms_raw, sai.voice_raw           ;\nrefresh   brond.brond_retrains_hist            ;\nrefresh   brond.td_dslam_week                  ;\nrefresh   ookla.ookla_android                  ;\nrefresh   ookla.ookla_ios                      ;\nrefresh   ookla.ookla_stnet                    ;\nrefresh   temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms ;\nrefresh   temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms   ;\n```\n### Notes from Data Engineering (Dionysia)\nThe Data Engineering team clarified why stats appear to be missing or outdated for certain streaming tables:\nAfter investigating the tables (sai.voice_quality_hist, sai.sms_raw, sai.voice_raw) we saw that we calculate statistics every morning for the previous day's data. These tables seem to fill up throughout the day, so the stats don't appear to be up to date.\nThe statistics refer to data in partitions of previous days.\n- In terms of performance, it is not possible to run compute statistics on partitions that continuously receive data during the day.\nThere are streams that load data every 5 minutes.\nDoing so would significantly delay data processing.\n- Obviously, the queries that are executed include the current partition and that is why the Warning for missing statistics is displayed.\nAttached you will find an example for sai.sms_raw for different par_dt, in which it appears that for historical data no warning is displayed.\nIf statistics are needed for specific tables, we should consider it as a project and not under Support.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\nThere are two source systems, HP Network Node Manager (NNM) and SNMP Custom Poller application, that poll periodically network elements and produces raw files with the instantaneous metrics. These files are then parsed by one or more procedures. Finally they are loaded to BigStreamer cluster in Impala tables. There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n### Component Metrics\nCovers memory and CPU usage metrics collection from NNM and their ingestion via Flume.\n#### Creation of raw files\nThe source system in this case is NNM. For high availability there are two instances of NNM on two separate servers and they operate in active-standby fashion. The whole infrastructure is entirely managed by abc. The raw files produced contain component metrics for CPU load and memory usage of the network elements and are stored in local paths on those servers.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n# Manage Wildfly---\ntitle: Manage Wildfly Application Servers in BigStreamer\ndescription: Step-by-step guide for managing Wildfly instances on BigStreamer edge nodes, including service control, networking details, load balancer routing, and environment-specific configurations for production, QA, and development.\ntags:\n  - wildfly\n  - bigstreamer\n  - loadbalancer\n  - netscaler\n  - internet-banking\n  - online\n  - rest-apis\n  - supervisorctl\n  - edge-nodes\n  - application-server\n  - deployment\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  application_servers:\n    - prodrestib\n    - prodreston\n    - prodrestibmetrics\n    - prodrestintapps\n  users:\n    - PRODREST\n  loadbalancers:\n    - Netscaler\n  sites:\n    - PR\n    - DR\n  virtual_ips:\n    - prodrestibank.mno.gr\n    - prodrestonline.mno.gr\n    - devrestibank.mno.gr\n    - devrestonline.mno.gr\n    - qarestibank.mno.gr\n    - qarestonline.mno.gr\n  ports:\n    - 8080\n    - 8081\n---\n## Scope\n{\"code\":0,\"info\":\"App is up and running.

Investigation revealed issues with the `PROD_Online_IngestStream` topology on the DR site, likely caused by resource bottlenecks in Kudu or Kafka ingestion delays.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account\n2. Inspected `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`\n3. From the `Monitoring Alerts` check the graphs `spark waiting batches` to find which topology has delays`\n4. Open MobaXterm `dr1edge01` ssh with your personal account\n5. Execute `firefox`\n6. Click the `DR` bookmark\n7. Check the logs of failed spark topology.\n8. Login to `DR cloudera manager` with your personal account\n9. Go to `CHARTS-->KAFKA_KUDU_DISK_UTIL` and see if abnormal rates on disk util exists\n10. Using Firefox on `dr1edge01`, navigate to the Kudu tablet Web UI for each DR node and inspect the **Memory Usage (detailed)** section. If any tablet exceeds 90% memory usage, restart the affected Kudu tablet via Cloudera Manager or systemd.\n11. Check again the graphs `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`\n12. If the alert appeared `(in our case appeared on PROD_Online_IngestStream topology)` restart the specific topology\n13. Open a new tab on MobaXterm `dr1edge01` ssh with your personal account\n14. sudo -iu `PRODREST`\n15. yarn application -list | grep \"PROD_Online_IngestStream\"\n16. yarn application -kill `<application_id>`\n17. Start again the topology `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh`\n18. Check from Graphana again the graphs `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`.\n19. Go to spark jobs history and click running.\n20. Click `Running-->Online_Ibank_IngestStream-->Streaming`\n21.
