    "question": "How does the Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP work?",
    "category": "Application Functionality & Flow",
    "ground_truth": "The Initialization/Synchronization Flow in TeMIP is managed by the Oozie Coordinator `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. It establishes a connection between the Wildfly Server running the TeMIP application and the TeMIP Server. This coordinator must be run manually after every restart or deployment of the Wildfly Server.",
    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator establishes the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. The workflow associated with this coordinator is `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`, which executes a master script located in HDFS to perform the synchronization tasks. \n\n    Please let me know if you need any further clarification or details.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Coordinator] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  C[TeMIP Server]\n  A --> |Establishes Connection| B\n  B --> |Communicates with| C\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP.

Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n# TeMIP\n## Overview\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\n- **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour.

    "chatbot_answer": " To create a Kerberos keytab file for user authentication, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Login to the kerb1 node as root**: Use SSH to connect to the kerb1 node and switch to the root user using `sudo -i`.\n2.  **Use the command-line interface to the Kerberos administration system**: Run the command `kadmin.local` to access the Kerberos administration system.\n3.  **Check if there is a principal for the corresponding username**: Use the command `listprincs <username>@CNE.abc.GR` to check if a principal exists for the specified username.\n4.  **Create a principal if there is not one**: If no principal exists, create one using the command `addprinc <username>@CNE.abc.GR`.\n5.  **Create the keytab**: Finally, create the keytab file using the command `ktadd -k /tmp/<username>.keytab -norandkey <username>@CNE.abc.GR`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a Kerberos keytab file for user authentication.\n\n**Additional Steps:**\n\nAfter creating the keytab file, you may need to copy it to another location or node, depending on your specific use case.\n\nFor example, if you need to use the keytab file on a different node, you can copy it using the `scp` command:\n\n```bash\nscp -p /tmp/<username>.keytab un2:/tmp\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `<username>` with the actual username and `un2` with the actual hostname or IP address of the destination node.\n\nAdditionally, after copying the keytab file, you may need to set the correct ownership and permissions on the file. This can typically be done using the `chown` and `chmod` commands:\n\n```bash\nchown skokkoris. /home/users/skokkoris/<username>.keytab\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `<username>` with the actual username and adjust the path and ownership as needed to match your specific use case.\n\nBy following these additional steps, you can ensure that the keytab file is properly copied, owned, and permissioned for use in your Kerberos authentication setup.",

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n3.

If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same.

After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n### Alert Mail\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/online_daily_batch_jobs.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/online_daily_batch_jobs_STABLE.sh` on `dr1edge01.mno.gr`/`pr1edge01.mno.gr` (each edge server submits to a different cluster)\n**Alerts**:\n- _See below_\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\nThis procedure runs multiple steps which we will describe below with seperate troubleshooting steps for each step.

We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\nmode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka2 999.999.999.999:9093\nlisten viavi-megafeed-kafka3_ssl\n   bind 999.999.999.999:9093\n   mode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka3 999.999.999.999:9093\n```\n## Procedure\n### Manage HAProxy\nStart - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl start haproxy\n```\nStop - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl stop haproxy\n```\nCheck - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl status haproxy\nss -tulnp | grep 9093 # Check listening port\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 3\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 3\n```\n### Manage DNS entries\nLogin to [IDM](https://admin.bigdata.abc.gr/ipa/ui/) with an administrative account to manage DNS entries\nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt;

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n2.

    "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot response provides a step-by-step guide on how to renew an expired RStudio Connect license. The instructions are detailed and include specific commands to be executed, which suggests that the chatbot has a good understanding of the technical aspects involved in renewing the license.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that some parts of the response seem somewhat generic or not entirely tailored to the specific query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license. For instance, steps related to fixing timezone, date, and time settings, while potentially relevant in a broader troubleshooting context, may not be directly pertinent to the primary task of renewing the license.\n\nDespite these observations, it's crucial to acknowledge that the chatbot response does indeed address the core question posed by the user. The instructions provided are clear, actionable, and directly related to the process of renewing an expired RStudio Connect license.\n\n### **Feedback:**\nGiven the detailed nature of the chatbot's response and its direct relevance to the query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license, I would argue that the response is largely on target. However, the inclusion of certain steps that might be considered tangential to the primary task of license renewal does slightly detract from the overall focus and efficiency of the response.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 4\n\nThis score reflects the chatbot's ability to provide a detailed, step-by-step guide that directly addresses the user's query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license.

    "chatbot_answer": " To verify the number of exported Location Mobility records, you can check the reconciliation files produced for each type of file (e.g., LM_02_lte, LM_03_smsIn, etc.). These reconciliation files contain information on the date of execution, the name of the file, the export date, and the number of lines it contains. By checking these reconciliation files, you can verify the number of exported Location Mobility records for each type of file. \n\n    Additionally, you can also check the log files produced by the scripts that export the Location Mobility data. These log files contain information on the execution of the scripts, including any errors or issues that may have occurred during the export process. By checking these log files, you can gain insight into the export process and verify that the expected number of Location Mobility records were exported.\n\n    It's also worth noting that if you need to export files for a specific date, you can execute the script with the `-t <yyyymmdd>` flag. For example, if you want to export the first 6 files for the 13th of March 2022, you can run the script with the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh -t 20220313 --max-files 6 >> /shared/abc/location_mobility/log/lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1\n    ```\n    This will instruct the script to catch-up, meaning to export files for the specified date. The `--max-files` flag specifies the maximum number of files to export.\n\n    By following these steps and using the provided commands, you can verify the number of exported Location Mobility records and ensure that the expected data is being exported correctly. \n\n    Please let me know if I can assist further!",

It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\n...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.
