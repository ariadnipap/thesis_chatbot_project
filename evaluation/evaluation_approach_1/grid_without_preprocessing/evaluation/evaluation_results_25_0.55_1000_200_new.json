    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator establishes the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. The workflow associated with this coordinator, `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`, executes a master script that performs the necessary synchronization tasks. This process ensures that the TeMIP Application is properly initialized and synchronized with the TeMIP Server, allowing for seamless communication and data exchange between these components.",

Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n# TeMIP\n## Overview\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\n- **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour.

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n3.

Just delete the `testuser`.\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3. Check the new user and from the right bar click `delete this entry`\n# For Case 2 follow the below steps:\nIdentify which `kerb` ldap instance has the issue.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\nB --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n## Manual Actions\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n- **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour.

After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```",

In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n## Procedure\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)",

The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/online_daily_batch_jobs.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/online_daily_batch_jobs_STABLE.sh` on `dr1edge01.mno.gr`/`pr1edge01.mno.gr` (each edge server submits to a different cluster)\n**Alerts**:\n- _See below_\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\nThis procedure runs multiple steps which we will describe below with seperate troubleshooting steps for each step.

It includes specific commands, parameters, and validation steps that are not mentioned in the chatbot response.\n\n2. **Technical Accuracy**: The reference answer demonstrates a higher level of technical accuracy and relevance to the specific context of the DWH_IBank application and Grafana. The chatbot response, while generally correct in its approach, lacks the specificity and technical depth found in the reference answer.\n\n3. **Relevance to Context**: Both responses aim to address the issue of a failed batch job in the context of the DWH_IBank application and Grafana. However, the reference answer is more closely tailored to this specific context, providing commands and steps that are directly relevant to troubleshooting issues within this particular application and environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the chatbot response provides a generally correct approach to troubleshooting a failed batch job, it lacks the specificity, technical accuracy, and relevance to context demonstrated by the reference answer.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 3**\n\nThis score reflects that the chatbot response is partially correct but misses key details and specificity found in the reference answer. The response demonstrates an understanding of the general approach to troubleshooting a failed batch job but lacks the technical depth, accuracy, and context-specific relevance required for a comprehensive solution.",
    "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot response is directly related to the query about steps to take when a batch job fails in Grafana for the DWH_IBank application. The response provides a clear, step-by-step guide on how to troubleshoot and potentially resolve issues with failed batch jobs.\n\n1. **Checking Spark Logs**: This step is crucial as it involves using specific tools (Firefox) on designated servers (`dr1edge01.mno.gr`/`pr1edge01.mno.gr`) to access logs via YARN Resource Manager UI. This indicates a high level of specificity and relevance to the query.\n\n2. **Identifying Cause of Failure**: By analyzing Spark logs, this step aims at determining why the batch job failed. This is directly in line with troubleshooting steps one would expect when dealing with failed jobs.\n\n3. **Rerunning Job (if necessary)**: After identifying and potentially fixing the cause of failure, this step involves communicating with specific administrators to rerun the job if necessary. This shows a clear understanding of not just the technical aspects but also the procedural and communicative aspects involved in troubleshooting batch job failures.\n\n### **Feedback:** \nThe chatbot response is highly relevant and directly addresses the query about steps to take when a batch job fails in Grafana for the DWH_IBank application. The response provides detailed, step-by-step instructions that cover both technical analysis (checking logs) and procedural actions (communicating with administrators to rerun jobs). This level of detail and relevance indicates that the chatbot has a strong understanding of the specific context and requirements of the query.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 5**",

We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\nmode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka2 999.999.999.999:9093\nlisten viavi-megafeed-kafka3_ssl\n   bind 999.999.999.999:9093\n   mode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka3 999.999.999.999:9093\n```\n## Procedure\n### Manage HAProxy\nStart - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl start haproxy\n```\nStop - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl stop haproxy\n```\nCheck - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl status haproxy\nss -tulnp | grep 9093 # Check listening port\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 3\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 3\n```\n### Manage DNS entries\nLogin to [IDM](https://admin.bigdata.abc.gr/ipa/ui/) with an administrative account to manage DNS entries\nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt;

    "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
    "ground_truth": "Kafka mirroring is implemented using Kafka MirrorMaker. Each site produces messages to a topic with the `-mir` suffix, which is then mirrored to the final topic without the suffix. PR and DR sites use MirrorMakers at specific nodes (e.g., `pr1node01.mno.gr` for PR and `dr1node01.mno.gr` for DR) to replicate data between sites, ensuring redundancy.",
    "chatbot_answer": " Kafka mirroring is implemented using MirrorMaker, which replicates traffic from the Primary Site Mirror Topics to the Disaster Site Final Topics. This ensures that both sites have all messages from both sites, allowing for redundancy and failover in the Online Banking system.\n\n    Additionally, there are two separate Spark Streaming topologies, one for Prod_Online_IngestStream and another for Prod_IBANK_IngestStream. These topologies consume records from the final Kafka topics, extract values, and write them to Kudu tables or HBase tables.\n\n    The MirrorMaker user is 'kafka', and the configuration, logs, and instructions for start/stop are managed through Cloudera Manager. There are also alerts set up for monitoring Kafka performance and REST endpoint response times. \n\n    In case of issues, troubleshooting steps include checking application logs for error messages, restarting problematic Wildfly instances, and checking for Kafka performance problems. \n\n    Overall, the Kafka mirroring implementation provides a robust and redundant system for the Online Banking system, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime in case of failures or maintenance activities.",
    "retrieved_context": "# Manage Kafka MirrorMaker\n## Scope\nKafka MirrorMaker has been configured with auto.offsets.reset=false. This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n## Setup\n1.

The instructions cover various aspects, including verifying the license status, updating configuration files, restarting RStudio Connect, and deleting users.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the provided response is overly lengthy and contains redundant information. For instance, the section on \"Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\" seems unrelated to the primary issue of resolving authentication problems after a password reset.\n\nFurthermore, some parts of the response appear to be copied from other sources without proper adaptation or contextualization.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n```\n3.
