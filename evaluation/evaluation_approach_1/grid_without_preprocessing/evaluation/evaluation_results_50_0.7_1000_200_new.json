    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator is responsible for establishing the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server.

Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n# TeMIP\n## Overview\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\n- **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour.

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n3.

Just delete the `testuser`.\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3.

The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1.

Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\nB --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1.

We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\nmode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka2 999.999.999.999:9093\nlisten viavi-megafeed-kafka3_ssl\n   bind 999.999.999.999:9093\n   mode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka3 999.999.999.999:9093\n```\n## Procedure\n### Manage HAProxy\nStart - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl start haproxy\n```\nStop - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl stop haproxy\n```\nCheck - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl status haproxy\nss -tulnp | grep 9093 # Check listening port\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 3\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 3\n```\n### Manage DNS entries\nLogin to [IDM](https://admin.bigdata.abc.gr/ipa/ui/) with an administrative account to manage DNS entries\nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt;

    "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
    "ground_truth": "If an RStudio user's applications fail to run after a password reset, check the LDAP authentication:\n1. SSH to `unrstudio1` and verify the `t1-svc-cnebind` account:\n   ```bash\n   ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D 't1-svc-cnebind' -W -b 'dc=groupnet,dc=gr' '(sAMAccountName=t1-svc-cnebind)'\n   ```\n2.

    "chatbot_answer": " To resolve an RStudio user authentication issue after resetting a password, you should first ensure that the time and date on your system are accurate. This is crucial because RStudio Connect uses timestamps to validate user sessions.\n\n     Next, verify that the LDAP authentication settings in RStudio Connect are correctly configured for your organization's LDAP server. This includes ensuring that the Base DN, Bind DN, and Bind Password are all correctly specified.\n\n     If you have recently reset a password for an RStudio Connect bind user (such as `t1-svc-cneranaibind`), ensure that you have updated the Bind Password in the RStudio Connect configuration to match the new password. You can do this by editing the `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg` file and updating the `BindPassword` field with the new password.\n\n     After making any necessary changes to your RStudio Connect configuration, restart the RStudio Connect service to apply the changes. You can do this by running the command `systemctl restart rstudio-connect`.\n\n     Finally, test the LDAP authentication settings by attempting to log in to RStudio Connect using a valid user account. If you encounter any issues or errors during the login process, review the RStudio Connect logs for more detailed information about the error.\n\n    By following these steps and verifying that your RStudio Connect configuration is correct, you should be able to resolve the user authentication issue and successfully log in to RStudio Connect using a valid user account.",

Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- ΧΡΥΣΟΣΤΟΜΟΣ Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- Χρυσοστομος Χαρισης, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n7. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n8. Due to the fact that the server is not directly connected to the Internet, R-Studio Connect might display an error about expired license after the reboot. In this case follow the steps listed [below](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect).\n9. Inform users that the application is available.\n### Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect\n1. Login to `unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr` as root via Cyberark\n2. Ensure that time is accurate and the time zone is correct for the machine.\n    ```bash\n    timedatectl\n    ```\n3.

Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n### Rstudio Lisence\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n### Delete user\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account.

The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### Ingestion Endpoint\n[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n```\n3.

    "chatbot_answer": " To verify the number of exported Location Mobility records, you can check the reconciliation files produced for each type of file (e.g., LM_02_lte, LM_03_smsIn, etc.). These reconciliation files contain information on the date of execution, the name of the file, the export date, and the number of lines it contains. By checking these reconciliation files, you can verify the number of exported Location Mobility records for each type of file. \n\n    Additionally, you can also check the log files produced by the scripts that export the Location Mobility data. These log files contain information on the execution of the scripts, including any errors or issues that may have occurred during the export process. By checking these log files, you can gain insight into the export process and verify that the expected number of Location Mobility records were exported.\n\n    It's also worth noting that if you need to export files for a specific date, you can execute the script with the `-t <yyyymmdd>` flag. For example, if you want to export the first 6 files for the 13th of March 2022, you can run the script with the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh -t 20220313 --max-files 6 >> /shared/abc/location_mobility/log/lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1\n    ```\n    This will instruct the script to catch-up, meaning to export files for the specified date. \n\n    By following these steps and using the provided commands, you should be able to verify the number of exported Location Mobility records and troubleshoot any issues that may have occurred during the export process.",

Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | FAILED  | com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.AppEmptyQueryException | 2023-05-10 07:05:02.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=1                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:05:22.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS |                                                                            | 2023-05-10 07:05:35.000 |\n+-------------+-----+------------+---------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+\n4 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n```\nAccording to the above results, we conclude that the computation of the QOS metrics for the selected 5min interval failed on the first attempt with AppEmptyQueryException error.
