    "question": "How does the Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP work?",
    "category": "Application Functionality & Flow",
    "ground_truth": "The Initialization/Synchronization Flow in TeMIP is managed by the Oozie Coordinator `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. It establishes a connection between the Wildfly Server running the TeMIP application and the TeMIP Server. This coordinator must be run manually after every restart or deployment of the Wildfly Server.",
    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator is responsible for establishing the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. The workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually to ensure synchronization, and it can also be executed by the corresponding coordinator according to a predefined schedule. \n\n    To verify if everything is running okay after the synchronization, one should login to Hue with temip user, open the impala editor, and execute specific queries to check for any errors or discrepancies in the data. If issues are found, re-running the TeMIP_Synchronization_WF workflow may be necessary to resolve them. \n\n    Overall, the Initialization/Synchronization flow is a critical component of the TeMIP system, ensuring that data is properly synchronized and communicated between different servers and applications. By following the outlined steps and troubleshooting procedures, users can effectively manage and maintain the Initialization/Synchronization flow in their TeMIP environment.",

The response could apply to a wide range of scenarios and contexts, rather than being tailored to the specific details and requirements of the provided context.\n\nIn light of these observations, it is clear that the chatbot's response, while well-structured and easy to follow, is not entirely grounded in the provided context and lacks specificity and concrete evidence to support its claims.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 3**\n\n**Feedback:** The chatbot's response is somewhat grounded in the provided context, but it lacks specificity and concrete evidence to support its claims. While the response does mention some relevant details, such as the purpose of the `ztab` file and its role in the decryption process, it fails to provide any specific examples or concrete evidence from the provided context to support its claims. Therefore, the chatbot's response is somewhat grounded, but with significant gaps. \n\nNote: The score is based on the evaluation of the chatbot's response in terms of its grounding in the provided context, specificity, and concrete evidence to support its claims. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$ \n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or details. \n\nI hope this helps!

Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n- **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

The results should be grouped by the `par_dt` field and ordered in descending order by the `par_dt` field.\n\nHere is an example query:\n```bash\nselect count(*), par_dt from energy_efficiency.cell where par_dt>'202111201' group by par_dt order by par_dt desc;\n```\nAdditionally, you can also check for duplicate records by executing a query that selects the count of distinct records from the `energy_efficiency.cell` table, where the `par_dt` field is equal to a specific date. For example:\n```bash\nselect count(*) from (select distinct * from energy_efficiency.cell where par_dt='20211210') a;\n```\nThis will give you the count of unique records in the `energy_efficiency.cell` table for the specified date.",

    "question": "How do I check HBase table quotas?",
    "category": "Data Management & Query Execution",
    "ground_truth": "Use the following HBase shell command:\n```bash\nlist_quotas\n```",
    "chatbot_answer": " To check HBase table quotas, you can use the `list_quotas` command in the HBase shell. This will display a list of all quotas currently set on the HBase cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this command:\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_quotas\n```\nThis will output a list of quotas, including the namespace, table name, and quota type (e.g. read, write, etc.). \n\nYou can also check quotas for a specific namespace or table by using the `set_quota` command with the `-namespace` or `-table` option.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\nlist_quotas\n```\nThis will set a quota of 20 requests per second on the `quotas_test` namespace, and then list all quotas currently set on the cluster. \n\nNote that you need to have the necessary permissions and access rights to view and manage HBase quotas. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that quotas are used to limit the amount of resources (e.g. read/write operations, memory, etc.) that can be used by a specific namespace, table, or user. Quotas can help prevent overloading and resource starvation, and can also be used to enforce security policies and access controls. \n\nTherefore, it's essential to carefully plan, configure, and monitor HBase quotas to ensure they are effective in achieving their intended purposes. \n\nI hope this helps!

    "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot response is directly related to the query about checking HBase table quotas. The response provides a clear and step-by-step guide on how to check these quotas using the `list_quotas` command in the HBase shell.\n\nFurthermore, the response includes examples of how to use this command, which enhances its clarity and usefulness. Additionally, the chatbot provides extra information about setting quotas for specific namespaces or tables, which demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the response is quite lengthy and repetitive in some parts. This might make it slightly overwhelming or difficult to follow for some users. Nonetheless, the overall quality and relevance of the response are excellent.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 5**\n\nThis score reflects the chatbot's ability to provide a clear, step-by-step guide that directly answers the user's query about checking HBase table quotas. The comprehensive nature of the response, including examples and additional relevant information, further justifies this perfect score. However, it is suggested that the chatbot could improve by making its responses more concise and less repetitive, which would enhance the overall user experience.",

The instructions are detailed and include specific commands and configurations.\n\nHowever, the query specifically asks how to check HBase table quotas. While the retrieved context provides information on setting and removing quotas, it does not directly address the question of checking existing quotas.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 3**\n\n**Feedback:** I gave this score because while the retrieved context is somewhat relevant to the topic of HBase quotas, it does not directly answer the specific question of how to check existing table quotas. The information provided is more focused on setting and removing quotas rather than checking or verifying existing quotas. Therefore, while there is some relevance, the context does not fully meet the requirements of the query.",

The response includes numerous instances of identical or similar sentences, which can make it difficult for the reader to discern the most important information.\n\nFurthermore, while the chatbot's response provides a clear explanation of how to check HBase table quotas, it does not provide any additional context or information that might be relevant to the user's query. For example, the response does not discuss the importance of monitoring HBase table quotas, or provide any guidance on how to interpret the results of the `list_quotas` command.\n\nIn light of these observations, I would give the chatbot's response a score of 4 out of 5.
