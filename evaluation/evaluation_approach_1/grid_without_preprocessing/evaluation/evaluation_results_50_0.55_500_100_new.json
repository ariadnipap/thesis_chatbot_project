This coordinator establishes the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. \n\n    To ensure successful synchronization, several steps can be taken:\n    1. Check if the TeMIP Server is running correctly by executing a ping command.\n    2. Contact a TeMIP admin to investigate any server-side issues.\n    3. Run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow manually through Hue with the temip user, ensuring it is not executed by the corresponding coordinator at the same time.\n\n    By following these steps and understanding the role of the OOZIE Coordinator in TeMIP's Initialization/Synchronization flow, one can effectively troubleshoot and ensure the successful operation of this critical component within the TeMIP system.",

    "chatbot_answer": " To troubleshoot the issue of not receiving alarms in the TeMIP Main Application, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check logs**: Look for any `ERROR` messages in the application and access logs using `temip-tailog`. This will help identify if there are any general errors or issues with the application.\n\n2. **Verify partitions and alarm counts**: Check for missing partitions in the `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` tables by running specific queries. Also, verify if there are any partitions containing less alarms than usual. This can indicate issues with the TeMIP server or the application.\n\n3. **Wait for terminated alarms to refresh**: If you need to reload historical data directly from the TeMIP Oracle Database into your terminated alarms table, wait for 7 days from the day you want to reload. This allows enough time for terminated alarms to be refreshed in the Oracle table.\n\n4. **Check TeMIP Server status**: Execute `ping 999.999.999.999` to see if the TeMIP Server is up and running.\n\n5. **Contact TeMIP admin**: Reach out to a TeMIP administrator to check if there are any server-side related issues that could be causing the problem with receiving alarms in the TeMIP Main Application. \n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and potentially resolve the issue of not receiving alarms in the TeMIP Main Application.",
    "retrieved_context": "The `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n- **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\t1.
