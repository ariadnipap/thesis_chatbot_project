    "category": "Application Functionality & Flow",
    "ground_truth": "The Initialization/Synchronization Flow in TeMIP is managed by the Oozie Coordinator `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. It establishes a connection between the Wildfly Server running the TeMIP application and the TeMIP Server. This coordinator must be run manually after every restart or deployment of the Wildfly Server.",
    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator is responsible for establishing the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. \n\n    To ensure successful synchronization, several steps can be taken:\n    1. Check if the TeMIP Server is running correctly by executing a ping command.\n    2. Contact a TeMIP admin to investigate any server-side issues.\n    3. Run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow manually through Hue as the temip user, ensuring it is not executed simultaneously by the corresponding coordinator.\n    4. After running the workflow, verify that it returns 15 rows as expected. If not, re-run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n\n    By following these steps and understanding the role of the OOZIE Coordinator and the manual execution of the synchronization workflow, you can ensure a successful Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP.",

The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

The response provides several potential reasons for this issue, including:\n\n1. Kafka and Kudu services being stopped during the decryption process.\n2. Issues with the fstab file, such as incorrect or missing entries for the decrypted disk.\n3. Conflicts with other mount points, which could be caused by incorrect or duplicate entries in the ztab file.\n\nThe chatbot's response also provides several commands that can be used to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue.

This ensures that both sites have all the messages from both sites, providing redundancy in the Online Banking system. The MirrorMakers use specific consumer groups, such as mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001 and mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002, and commit offsets to the respective Kafka clusters.```",

The query is well-structured and includes all necessary parameters such as application, component, status, and time interval.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the provided SQL query contains some minor differences compared to the reference answer. For instance, the chatbot response uses `SELECT` with specific column names, whereas the reference answer uses `SELECT *`. Additionally, the chatbot response includes an extra condition `component=\"MAIN_END\"` which is not present in the reference answer.\n\nDespite these minor discrepancies, the provided SQL query still appears to be generally correct and should produce the desired results. Therefore, based on the given information and the scoring criteria, I would assign a score of 4 to the chatbot response.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 4**",
    "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot's response directly addresses the query by providing a specific SQL command. This command is tailored to check failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM, which perfectly aligns with the user's request.\n\nFurthermore, the response includes an explanation of what the provided SQL command does. It details how the command connects to the monitoring database, selects relevant columns from the `jobstatus` table, filters for specific conditions (failed executions of the IPVPN-SM application within the last day), and returns the results. This additional information enhances the user's understanding of the solution provided.\n\nGiven the direct relevance of the chatbot's response to the query, along with the comprehensive explanation that accompanies the SQL command, it is clear that the response fully meets the requirements specified in the query.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 5**",

The query asks for the command to check failed executions in the Monitoring database.\n\nUpon examining the retrieved context, it appears that there are several sections and subsections discussing different aspects of monitoring and troubleshooting for IPVPN-SM. However, not all sections directly address the specific query about checking failed executions in the Monitoring database.\n\nThe section titled \"Monitoring DB\" does provide relevant information on how to connect to the monitoring database and execute a query to check the status of requests. This includes an example query that filters for failed requests within a specified time frame (e.g., the past 24 hours).\n\nGiven this analysis, it appears that the retrieved context does contain relevant information that addresses the query about checking failed executions in the Monitoring database.\n\n### **Feedback:**\nThe score is based on the relevance of the provided context to the specific query. While not all sections of the context are directly relevant, the section titled \"Monitoring DB\" provides crucial information and an example query that directly addresses the query's request for a command to check failed executions in the Monitoring database.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 4**",
