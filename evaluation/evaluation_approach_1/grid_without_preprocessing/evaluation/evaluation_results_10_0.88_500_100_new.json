    "category": "Application Functionality & Flow",
    "ground_truth": "The Initialization/Synchronization Flow in TeMIP is managed by the Oozie Coordinator `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. It establishes a connection between the Wildfly Server running the TeMIP application and the TeMIP Server. This coordinator must be run manually after every restart or deployment of the Wildfly Server.",
    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator establishes the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. \n\n    To ensure successful synchronization, several steps can be taken:\n    1. Check if the TeMIP Server is running correctly by executing a ping command.\n    2. Contact a TeMIP admin to investigate any server-side issues.\n    3. Run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow manually through Hue as the temip user, ensuring it is not executed simultaneously by the corresponding coordinator.\n\n    Following these steps helps ensure that the Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP operates correctly, facilitating effective communication and data exchange between the Wildfly Server and the TeMIP Server.",

The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n1. Main Application flow\n1.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

    "retrieved_context": "The `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n- **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour.

Select **Create New** button at the bottom of the view.\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\nIf it is not been imported, you should import them using formula  `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain so we can verify that the change is succesfully made. \nVaggos username in our case (enomikos)\n3. Customer should also send a bind user that we will use for groupnet domain configuration.\n```\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n<b>Description:</b>\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\nServer:\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\nUseful info:\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n### Prerequisites\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- ΧΡΥΣΟΣΤΟΜΟΣ Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- Χρυσοστομος Χαρισης, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n- [Home URL](https://999.999.999.999:8888/)\n- **User:** `admin`\n- **Password:** [abc-syspasswd.kdbx](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/abc-syspasswd.kdbx)\n#### Change logging level\n1. Login to the `WildFly Management` by following the [home url](https://999.999.999.999:10213/console/App.html#home), select `Configuration` ~> `Subsystems` ~> `Logging` and select `View`.\n1.
