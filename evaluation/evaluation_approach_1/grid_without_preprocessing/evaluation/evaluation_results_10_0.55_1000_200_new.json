    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator is responsible for establishing the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. The workflow associated with this coordinator is `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`, which executes a master script located in HDFS. This process ensures that the TeMIP application is properly synchronized with the TeMIP server, allowing for seamless communication and data exchange.",

Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n# TeMIP\n## Overview\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\n- **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour.

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n3.

Just delete the `testuser`.\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1.

If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)",

    "chatbot_answer": " The decrypted disk may not be mounting after following the procedure because the fstab file was not updated correctly. Specifically, the line for the decrypted mount point may still be commented out in the /etc/fstab file. To resolve this issue, you should uncomment the relevant line in the /etc/fstab file and then run the command `mount -a` to remount the filesystems. \n\nAdditionally, it's also possible that the disk is not mounting due to other issues such as file system errors or disk hardware problems. In such cases, you may need to run file system checks or diagnostic tools to identify and fix the underlying issue. \n\nIt's always a good idea to check the system logs and mount command output for any error messages or clues that can help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue. \n\nIn summary, to resolve the issue of the decrypted disk not mounting, you should first check the fstab file and update it if necessary, then run the `mount -a` command to remount the filesystems.

The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/online_daily_batch_jobs.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/online_daily_batch_jobs_STABLE.sh` on `dr1edge01.mno.gr`/`pr1edge01.mno.gr` (each edge server submits to a different cluster)\n**Alerts**:\n- _See below_\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\nThis procedure runs multiple steps which we will describe below with seperate troubleshooting steps for each step.

    "judge_feedback_groundedness": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot response provides a step-by-step guide on how to upgrade Java on a server running Wildfly. The response is well-structured and easy to follow.\n\nThe response starts by backing up the old Java version, which is a crucial step to ensure that the upgrade process does not result in data loss.\n\nThe response then proceeds to update the Java package using YUM, which is the recommended method for updating packages on a Linux system.\n\nAfter updating the Java package, the response instructs the user to copy the old certificates into the new installation directory. This step is necessary to ensure that the upgraded Java version can still access the required certificates.\n\nThe response then proceeds to run the update alternatives tool, which is used to configure the default Java version on the system.\n\nFinally, the response instructs the user to verify the Java version by running the command `java -version`. This step is necessary to ensure that the upgrade process was successful and that the correct version of Java is being used.\n\nOverall, the chatbot response provides a clear and concise guide on how to upgrade Java on a server running Wildfly. The response is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a useful resource for system administrators who need to perform this task.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 5\n\nThe chatbot response is fully grounded in the retrieved context and provides a clear and concise guide on how to upgrade Java on a server running Wildfly.

    "chatbot_answer": " To resolve an RStudio user authentication issue after resetting a password, you should first ensure that the time and timezone on your system are accurate. Then, restart the RStudio Connect service to apply any changes. If issues persist, verify the license status of RStudio Connect and re-activate the license if necessary. Additionally, check for any duplicate users or accounts that may be causing conflicts during authentication. By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the user authentication issue in RStudio after resetting a password.\n    ```bash\n    systemctl restart rstudio-connect\n    ```\n7. Press `Test authentication`\n## R-Studio Connect - t1-svc-cnebind\n1. Inform users for downtime of approximate 1 hour\n2. Login to `unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr` as root via Cyberark\n3.

The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### Ingestion Endpoint\n[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n```\n3.

Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\n- HTTP port : `13000`\n      - JMX port : `13800`\n- External SQM server:\n\t- **host**: `gw-prod-sqm.aksprd.abc.gr`\n\t- **port**: `443`\n\t- **endpoint**: `/inventory/measurements`\n## Bash scripts\nIn addition to the IPVPN-SM application, IPVPN-SM utilizes certain bash scripts. Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`\nThe specific order in which they are called is the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR",

    "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot response provides a step-by-step guide on how to renew an expired RStudio Connect license. The instructions are detailed and include specific commands to be executed, which suggests that the chatbot has a good understanding of the technical aspects involved in renewing the license.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that some parts of the response seem somewhat generic or not entirely tailored to the specific query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license. For instance, steps related to fixing timezone, date, and time settings, while potentially relevant in a broader troubleshooting context, may not be directly pertinent to the primary task of renewing the license.\n\nDespite these observations, it's crucial to acknowledge that the chatbot response does indeed address the core question posed by the user. The instructions provided are clear, actionable, and directly related to the process of renewing an expired RStudio Connect license.\n\n### **Feedback:**\nGiven the detailed nature of the chatbot's response and its direct relevance to the query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license, I would argue that the response is largely on target. However, the inclusion of certain steps that might be considered tangential to the primary task of license renewal does slightly detract from the overall focus and efficiency of the response.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 4\n\nThis score reflects the chatbot's ability to provide a detailed, step-by-step guide that directly addresses the user's query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license.

    "chatbot_answer": " To verify the number of exported Location Mobility records, you can check the reconciliation files produced for each type of file (e.g., LM_02_lte, LM_03_smsIn, etc.). These reconciliation files contain information on the date of execution, the name of the file, the export date, and the number of lines it contains. By checking these reconciliation files, you can verify the number of exported Location Mobility records for each type of file. \n\n    Additionally, you can also check the log files produced by the scripts that export the Location Mobility records. These log files contain information on the execution of the scripts, including any errors or issues that may have occurred during the export process. By checking these log files, you can gain insight into the export process and verify that the expected number of Location Mobility records were exported.\n\n    It's also worth noting that if you need to export files for a specific date, you can execute the script with the `-t <yyyymmdd>` flag. For example, if you want to export the first 6 files for the 13th of March 2022, you can run the script with the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh -t 20220313 --max-files 6 >> /shared/abc/location_mobility/log/lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1\n    ```\n    This will instruct the script to catch-up, meaning to export files for the specified date. The `--max-files` flag specifies the maximum number of files to export.\n\n    By following these steps and using the provided commands, you can verify the number of exported Location Mobility records and ensure that the expected data is being exported correctly. \n\n    Please let me know if I can assist further!",

Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\nlist_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n- Set throttle quotas of type 'read'\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'read'\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_read_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\nn_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/hbase2\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads\nhttps://blog.cloudera.com/hbase-performance-testing-using-ycsb/\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash",
