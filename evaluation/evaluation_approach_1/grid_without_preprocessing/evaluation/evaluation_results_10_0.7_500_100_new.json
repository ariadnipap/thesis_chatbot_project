    "question": "How does the Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP work?",
    "category": "Application Functionality & Flow",
    "ground_truth": "The Initialization/Synchronization Flow in TeMIP is managed by the Oozie Coordinator `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. It establishes a connection between the Wildfly Server running the TeMIP application and the TeMIP Server. This coordinator must be run manually after every restart or deployment of the Wildfly Server.",
    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator establishes the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. \n\n    To ensure successful synchronization, several steps can be taken:\n    1. Check if the TeMIP Server is up by executing a ping command.\n    2. Contact a TeMIP admin to investigate any server-side issues.\n    3. Run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow manually through Hue as the temip user, ensuring it's not executed simultaneously by the corresponding coordinator.\n    4. After running the workflow, verify that it returns 15 rows as expected. If not, re-run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n\n    By following these steps and understanding the role of the OOZIE Coordinator and the workflows involved, you can effectively manage and troubleshoot the Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP.",

The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n1.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

This involves creating a `listen` block for each Kafka broker and specifying the `bind` address, `mode`, `balance`, and `server` options.\n3. **Manage DNS entries**: Assign hostnames from Kafka Brokers to the internal IPs added in step 1.
