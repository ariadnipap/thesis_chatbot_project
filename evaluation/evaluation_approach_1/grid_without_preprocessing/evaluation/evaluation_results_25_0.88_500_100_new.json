    "category": "Application Functionality & Flow",
    "ground_truth": "The Initialization/Synchronization Flow in TeMIP is managed by the Oozie Coordinator `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. It establishes a connection between the Wildfly Server running the TeMIP application and the TeMIP Server. This coordinator must be run manually after every restart or deployment of the Wildfly Server.",
    "chatbot_answer": " The Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP is facilitated by an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. This coordinator is responsible for establishing the connection and communication between the Wildfly Server (containing the TeMIP Application) and the TeMIP Server. \n\n    To ensure successful synchronization, several steps can be taken:\n    1. Check if the TeMIP Server is running correctly by executing a ping command.\n    2. Contact a TeMIP admin to investigate any server-side issues.\n    3. Run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow manually through Hue as the temip user, ensuring it is not executed simultaneously by the corresponding coordinator.\n    4. After running the workflow, verify that it returns 15 rows as expected. If not, re-run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n\n    By following these steps and understanding the role of the OOZIE Coordinator and the manual execution of the synchronization workflow, you can ensure a successful Initialization/Synchronization flow in TeMIP.",

The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

    "chatbot_answer": " ```\n\nTo renew Kubernetes certificates for RAN.AI, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Login and become root**: Login to `kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr` with your personal account and become root using `sudo su -`.\n\n2. **Check certificates expiration date**: Run `kubeadm certs check-expiration` to check the current expiration dates of the certificates.\n\n3. **Backup Kubernetes configuration**: Copy the Kubernetes configuration to a temporary location for backup: `cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/`.\n\n4. **Backup Intelligent Service Account**: Backup the intelligent service account configuration: `cp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/`.\n\n5. **Renew certificates**: Renew all Kubernetes certificates using `kubeadm certs renew all`. Then, verify the renewal by checking the expiration dates again with `kubeadm certs check-expiration`.\n\n6. **Update kubeconfig**: Update the `kubeconfig` file to use the new certificates. This involves copying the new admin configuration to your user directory: `cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config`. Ensure you have the correct permissions and that the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set correctly if you are using a custom location for your `kubeconfig` file.\n\n7. **Update Intelligent Service Account Configuration**: Update the intelligent service account configuration with the new certificates. This involves editing the `~/.kube/config` file for the intelligent service account and replacing the old certificate data with the new data obtained from the renewed certificates.\n\n8. **Restart affected services**: After renewing the certificates, you need to restart the affected Kubernetes services (e.g., controller-manager, scheduler) to ensure they pick up the new certificates.\n\n9. **Verify functionality**: Finally, verify that all Kubernetes components are functioning correctly with the new certificates by running commands like `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl get pods -A`, and checking the logs of system components for any errors related to certificate validation or connectivity issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully renew your Kubernetes certificates for RAN.AI. Remember to always backup critical configurations before making changes and to thoroughly test your environment after completing the renewal process.",

    "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
    "ground_truth": "Modify `haproxy.cfg` to include new brokers, restart HAProxy, and update DNS records in the cluster to map internal hostnames to Viavi Kafka brokers.",
    "chatbot_answer": " To configure Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer, you need to set up HAProxy configuration and manage DNS entries. The setup involves adding new IPs to the Incelligent node, assigning hostnames from the Kafka Brokers to these internal IPs, and creating DNS entries on the cluster's internal DNS. Additionally, you need to configure the application by updating the `translogApiOnlineJmxConfig.xml` file located at `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/`. \n\n    Please note that this is a complex process and requires careful planning and execution to ensure successful connectivity between Viavi Kafka and BigStreamer. \n\n    Also, it's important to monitor the application logs and access logs to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during or after the configuration process. The application logs are located at `/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/server.log`, and the access logs are located at `/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/access.log`. \n\n    By following these steps and monitoring the logs, you should be able to successfully configure Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer. \n\n    Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

It offers a detailed guide on troubleshooting and fixing OpenLDAP replication issues, which indirectly provides methods for verifying the replication status. Therefore, the score of 5 is justified due to the high relevance and usefulness of the retrieved context in addressing the query.",

Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails.

In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred.
