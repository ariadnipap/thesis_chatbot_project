If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n# TeMIP\n## Overview\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\n## Useful Links\n- [TeMIP Dir](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/temip)\n- [TeMIP Application Deployment](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/temip/temip-devops/-/wikis/Application-Deployment)\n- [TeMIP Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/temip/temip-devops/-/wikis/home)\n- **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n## Pollaploi Flow\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`",

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n3.

Just delete the `testuser`.\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3. Check the new user and from the right bar click `delete this entry`\n# For Case 2 follow the below steps:\nIdentify which `kerb` ldap instance has the issue. For example check if they had the same ammount of `users` and `groups` with `ldapsearch` commands from checks\nFrom the `kerb` ldap instance without corruption :\n```bash\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation.

This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n### Alert Mail\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\nB --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1.

Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:\n# TeMIP\n## Overview\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\nperceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\n        0 useridentifier,\n        usertext as user_Text,\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\n        null deleted,\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\n        --,*\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\n        ```\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \n    1. Check if data transferred successfully by running the command below and comparing the result with the number of retrieved records in the logs produced by the script.  \n      ``` sql\n      SELECT par_dt, count(*) FROM temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms where par_dt > 'v';\n      Eg. Logs: INFO mapreduce.ImportJobBase: Retrieved 1113488 records.\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`",

After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same.

Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config.

After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same.

Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\nFrom node01:\n#### Node certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n#### JKS certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config.

Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1.

Each site produces messages to a topic with the `-mir` suffix, which is then mirrored to the final topic without the suffix. PR and DR sites use MirrorMakers at specific nodes (e.g., `pr1node01.mno.gr` for PR and `dr1node01.mno.gr` for DR) to replicate data between sites, ensuring redundancy.",
        "chatbot_answer": " Kafka mirroring is implemented using MirrorMaker, which replicates traffic from one site to another. The implementation involves multiple MirrorMakers running on different nodes, each responsible for replicating specific topics. The MirrorMakers use consumer groups to manage offsets and ensure that messages are not lost during replication. Overall, the Kafka mirroring implementation provides redundancy and ensures that the Online Banking system remains available even in the event of a failure at one site.\n```",
        "retrieved_context": "# Manage Kafka MirrorMaker\n## Scope\nKafka MirrorMaker has been configured with auto.offsets.reset=false. This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n## Setup\n1. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node01 and pr1node04:\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n2.

Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n### Rstudio Lisence\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n### Rstudio Lisence\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n### Delete user\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n7. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n8. Due to the fact that the server is not directly connected to the Internet, R-Studio Connect might display an error about expired license after the reboot. In this case follow the steps listed [below](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect).\n9. Inform users that the application is available.\n### Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect\n1. Login to `unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr` as root via Cyberark\n2. Ensure that time is accurate and the time zone is correct for the machine.\n    ```bash\n    timedatectl\n    ```\n3. Sync date and time to hardware clock of the machine.\n    ``` bash\n    hwclock -w\n    ```\n4. Deactivate license\n    ``` bash\n    export http_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    export https_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n<b>Description:</b>\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\nServer:\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\nUseful info:\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n### Prerequisites\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n### Backup\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n```\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n# abc - [One Domain] RCPE integration with GROUPNET\n<b>Description:</b>\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\nServers:\n999.999.999.999 PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n999.999.999.999 PVDCLAM01.groupnet.gr\nUseful info:\nPROD\n- rcpe1.bigdata.abc.gr, rcpe2.bigdata.abc.gr, \n- https://999.999.999.999:8843/rcpe/#/login\n- https://999.999.999.999:8843/rcpe/#/login\n- https://cne.def.gr:8843/rcpe/#/login\nTEST\n- unc2.bigdata.abc.gr\n- https://999.999.999.999:8743/rcpe/\n```\n> Ndef: Following procedure occurs for test. Be sure to apply the same steps for prod \n### Prerequisites\n1.

        "chatbot_answer": " To configure Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Setup**: Ensure that the Incelligent node has three new IPs (VLAN 300) added and assigned hostnames from the Kafka Brokers to these internal IPs with DNS entries on the cluster's internal DNS.\n\n2. **HAProxy Configuration**: Configure HAProxy to route traffic from BigStreamer to Viavi's Kafka Cluster. This involves setting up HAProxy listeners, backend servers, and routing rules.\n\n3. **Kafka Mirrorring**: Ensure that Kafka mirroring is set up correctly between the primary and disaster recovery (DR) sites. This involves configuring Kafka MirrorMaker to replicate topics between the two sites.\n\n4. **Spark Streaming**: Configure Spark Streaming topologies to consume data from Viavi's Kafka Cluster and process it accordingly. This may involve setting up multiple Spark Streaming jobs to handle different types of data or processing requirements.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up monitoring and alerting tools to track the health and performance of the Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer. This may include setting up metrics collection, logging, and alerting tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and PagerDuty.\n\nBy following these steps, you can configure Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer and ensure reliable and efficient data processing and analytics.",

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n2.

        "category": "Data Management & Query Execution",
        "ground_truth": "To check access logs for `prodrestib`, run:\n```bash\ntail -f /var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To monitor Wildfly access logs, you can use the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    tail -f /var/log/wildfly/prodreston/access.log\n    ```\n    This will display the latest entries in the access log file. You can also use other commands like `less` or `grep` to filter and analyze the log data.\n```# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **Understanding the task**: The question asks how to monitor Wildfly access logs.\n\n2. **Identifying relevant information**: The context provides the location of the access log file for a specific Wildfly instance (`/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/access.log`).\n\n3. **Determining the appropriate command**: To monitor the access log, one can use the `tail -f` command, which displays the last few lines of a file and updates the display in real-time as new lines are added to the file.\n\n# Fixed solution:\n```bash\ntail -f /var/log/wildfly/prodreston/access.log\n```\n\n# Explanation of changes:\n* **No changes were necessary** because the provided context already points towards using `tail -f` for monitoring log files, and it specifies the correct path to the access log file.\n\n# Tests and example uses:\nTo test this solution, you can follow these steps:\n1. Open a terminal and connect via SSH to the server where the Wildfly instance is running.\n2. Navigate to the directory from which you want to run the command (this is not strictly necessary since the path to the log file is absolute).\n3. Run the `tail -f` command with the path to the access log file as shown in the fixed solution above.\n4. The terminal will start displaying the latest entries from the access log file. As new requests are processed by Wildfly, you will see these new entries appended to the output in real-time.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided `tail -f` command, you can effectively monitor the Wildfly access logs for a specific instance.",

This will instruct the script to catch-up meaning to export files for N 4-hour intervals. This is not needed if 4 or less dates were missed in which case the procedure will automatically catch up.

The response should avoid repetitive phrases and focus on providing clear and relevant information to help the user resolve their issue. \n\nIn order to improve, the chatbot should be trained on a dataset that emphasizes concise and direct communication. The chatbot should also be designed with features that encourage clear and relevant responses, such as natural language processing algorithms and machine learning models. \n\nBy implementing these improvements, the chatbot can provide more helpful and accurate responses to user questions, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience. \n\nIn conclusion, while the chatbot response provides some relevant information, it falls short of providing a clear and concise solution to the user's question. By improving the chatbot's design and training data, we can enhance the overall quality of the chatbot's responses and provide a better user experience. \n\nTherefore, I would give this chatbot response a score of 2 out of 5, indicating that while it provides some relevant information, it falls short of providing a clear and concise solution to the user's question. \n\nI hope this feedback is helpful in improving the chatbot's performance and providing a better user experience. \n\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. \n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name] \n\nP.S.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_write_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_read_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)",

For example check if they had the same ammount of `users` and `groups` with `ldapsearch` commands from checks\nFrom the `kerb` ldap instance without corruption :\n```bash\n...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n    ```log\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n    Now replication works.\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\nLogin into admin node as root:\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: (https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/)\nAfter succesfully creation of `testuser` check if exist on `kerb2` from the dropdown menu or via ldapsearch\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=testuser'\n```\nIf user exist then replication fixed. Just delete the `testuser`.\nThe procedure to delete a new user described [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/openldap_change_manager_password.md)\n```\n6. Modify Manager password:\n```bash\nldapmodify -H ldapi:// -Y EXTERNAL -f changepwmanager.ldif\nldapmodify -H ldapi:// -Y EXTERNAL -f changepwconfig.ldif\n```\n7. Checks \na. Via command line\nFor `kerb1`. Where `uid` add a ldap user. e.g your ldap username:\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=xxxx'\n```\nFor `kerb2`. Where `uid` add a ldap user. e.g your ldap username::\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=xxxx'\n```\nb.
