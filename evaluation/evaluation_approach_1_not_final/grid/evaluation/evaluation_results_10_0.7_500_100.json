First, check the current configuration:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'grep \"^PermitRootLogin\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config'\n```\nThen, modify the configuration to disallow root login:\n```bash\nsed -i -e 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\nApply the changes using:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.script salt://disable_root_login.sh\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'service sshd reload'\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To prevent root SSH login on all servers, you can modify the SSH configuration file. \n\n    Specifically, you need to set the \"PermitRootLogin\" option to \"no\". This will prevent root users from logging in via SSH.\n\n    The steps to achieve this are as follows:\n\n1. Open the SSH configuration file using a text editor like vi. The file is usually located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n2. Locate the line that starts with \"PermitRootLogin\".\n3. If the line is present, change its value to \"no\". If the line is not present, add it with the value \"no\".\n4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.\n5. Restart the SSH service to apply the changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can prevent root users from logging in via SSH on all your servers.",

However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the instructions are overly complicated and not directly relevant to creating a support ticket.\n\nFor instance, steps 1 and 2 involve using ssh and ipmitool to find the Management IP, which seems unnecessary for simply opening a support case. Furthermore, step 3 requires connecting via VNC and accessing the IDRAC interface, which again appears to be an overly complex approach to merely obtaining support.\n\nIn contrast, the reference answer provides a straightforward and logical sequence of steps to create a Dell support ticket. It begins with retrieving the service tag from iDRAC, followed by exporting lifecycle logs, opening a case on Dell Support with the service tag, sending the exported TSR zip file to Dell, and finally following Dell\u2019s instructions for any necessary updates.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 2**\n\nThe chatbot response provided steps that were overly complicated and not directly relevant to creating a support ticket.

The chatbot correctly states that without more specific details about the issue or the table, it cannot recommend any changes.\n\nHowever, the chatbot does not attempt to provide any general guidance or potential troubleshooting steps that might be applicable to table loading issues in general. This lack of additional support or suggestions means that while the chatbot's response is technically correct and grounded in the provided context (or rather, the lack thereof), it could be more helpful.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 4**\n\nThe reason for this score is that while the chatbot correctly identifies that there is no relevant information in the provided context to address the specific issue with the `brond.an_rollout_data_hist` table, its response could benefit from additional general guidance or troubleshooting suggestions. However, given the strict interpretation of the task and the emphasis on grounding in the retrieved context, the chatbot's response demonstrates a good understanding of the limitations imposed by the provided context. \n\nThus, while there is room for improvement in terms of providing more comprehensive support or suggestions, the chatbot's response is well-grounded in the context that was available to it.

Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=0                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:04:51.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | FAILED  | com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.AppEmptyQueryException | 2023-05-10 07:05:02.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=1                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:05:22.000 |\n#### Inspect specific metric request\nIn case of alerts, we should first check the status of the particular requests on the monitoring DB.\nUsing the metric category and the reference interval associated with a request to IPVPN-SM App we can query the Monitoring DB\nby passing the corresponding job and operative_partition values.\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`",
