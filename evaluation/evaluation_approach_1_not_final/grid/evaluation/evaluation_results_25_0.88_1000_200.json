        "ground_truth": "To disable root SSH login on all servers, modify the SSH configuration. First, check the current configuration:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'grep \"^PermitRootLogin\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config'\n```\nThen, modify the configuration to disallow root login:\n```bash\nsed -i -e 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\nApply the changes using:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.script salt://disable_root_login.sh\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'service sshd reload'\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To prevent root SSH login on all servers, you can modify the SSH configuration file to disable root login. This can be done by adding or modifying the following line in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:\n    ```\n    PermitRootLogin no\n    ```\n    After making this change, you will need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the following command:\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl restart sshd\n    ```\n    Alternatively, you can also use the following command to reload the SSH configuration without restarting the service:\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl reload sshd\n    ``` \n    By making this change, you will prevent root users from logging in via SSH, which can help improve the security of your servers. \n\n    Additionally, it's a good practice to use a non-root user with sudo privileges for administrative tasks, rather than using the root account directly. This can provide an additional layer of security and accountability. \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Disable root SSH login on all servers\necho \"PermitRootLogin no\" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n# Restart the SSH service to apply the changes\nsudo systemctl restart sshd\n\n# Alternatively, you can also use the following command to reload the SSH configuration without restarting the service:\n# sudo systemctl reload sshd\n``` \n    You are an AI assistant.

Check for open ports: You can use tools like `netstat` or `nmap` to check if specific ports are open on the node.

In this short guide, it explained how you can repair the replication on the MySQL slave. This guide is for MySQL.\n### Glossary\n- MYSQL replication: It is a process that enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to copied automatically to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)\n## Setup\n### Mysql Instances\n#### PR\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n      tar -ztvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz | grep -i mysql_backup # List contents of the tar.gz file.Under backup folder stored tar.gz files from daily backup procedure,for both sites, with the format CLUSTER_year-month-day.tar.gz (e.g DRBDA_2022-03-21.tar.gz).

The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1.

If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1.

Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1.

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

Just delete the `testuser`.\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1.

After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```",

Open `logs` and apply some filters in order to retrieve the information related to the specific pipeline. Logs can be found at `/shared/sdc/log/sdc.log`. To search logs use `grep` or open log file with `less sdc.log` and search `'/'`.\n    1.

        "retrieved_context": "# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring. In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n## Procedure\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)",

The error has to do with HBase merging/spliting on a region server, but a detailed reason is unknown.\n# Benchmarking HBASE on Lab with YCSB Tool\n## Introduction\nOur purpose was to run performance tests on a created Hbase table on Lab environment and document the results which will be used as a point of reference to evaluate the efficacy of quotas that will be applied. After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n**Alerts**:\n- Retention IbankCleanupHbaseSAS JOB\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n- After the root cause for the failure is resolved, check on `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/no_bkp/duplicate_cid_hbase` if a manual re-run must be done for a specific date\n  - For a specified date eg 2022-06-30:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_tools_cleanupHbaseSAS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_STREAM LIST 20220630\n    ```\n##  Oozie Jobs\n###  Lookup tables\nEvery day (at 07:15 by Oozie on DR & PR site ), we transfers 3 tables with reference data from the legacy MSSQL server, which is managed by mno, to the cluster. We keep only latest version to BigData (no partition).\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Coordinator**: `Coord_IbankLookupTables_PROD`\n**Workflow**: `ImportLookupTables`\n**Local path**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/hdfs_mirror/lookupTables/import_lookup_tables.sh`\n**Logs**: from HUE\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors. You can also try to kill (use Cloudera Manager or yarn command) and then re-submit the topology.\n## Batch\n### Main script\nAs mentioned before, the information processed by the [Prod_Online_IngestStream](#prod_online_ingeststream) topology is stored in Kudu/HBase tables. At the end of each day (at **4:15 am in PR & DR site** by **Cron**) the records from HBase/Kudu is enriched with additional information and the transfered to a parquet table. After the data are inserted to the parquet table, sequent jobs are triggered to produce aggregations and data for external systems. This procedure runs **independantly on both sites**.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/online_daily_batch_jobs.log`\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors. You can also try to kill (use Cloudera Manager or yarn command) and then re-submit the topology.\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible\n**Visible transaction**: Visible are considered transactions from applications that have show_customer marked as true in the Impala table `prod_trlog_ibank.service_name`.\nThis topology takes **visible** records from the final Kafka topics and writes them to HBase tables. This topology runs independently **on both clusters**.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream] --> C[Spark: Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible]\n  B[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_name] -->|Queried every 6 hours| C[Spark: Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible]\n  C --> D[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT]\n  C --> E[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_CLUN_APP]\n  C --> F[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_ID]",

We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\nmode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka2 999.999.999.999:9093\nlisten viavi-megafeed-kafka3_ssl\n   bind 999.999.999.999:9093\n   mode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka3 999.999.999.999:9093\n```\n## Procedure\n### Manage HAProxy\nStart - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl start haproxy\n```\nStop - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl stop haproxy\n```\nCheck - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl status haproxy\nss -tulnp | grep 9093 # Check listening port\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 3\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 3\n```\n### Manage DNS entries\nLogin to [IDM](https://admin.bigdata.abc.gr/ipa/ui/) with an administrative account to manage DNS entries\nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt;

This ensures that both sites have all messages from both sites, allowing for redundancy and failover in the Online Banking system.\n\n    Additionally, there are two separate Spark Streaming topologies, one for Prod_Online_IngestStream and another for Prod_IBANK_IngestStream. These topologies consume records from the final Kafka topics, extract values, and write them to Kudu tables or HBase tables.\n\n    The MirrorMaker user is 'kafka', and the configuration, logs, and instructions for start/stop are managed through Cloudera Manager. There are also alerts set up for monitoring Kafka performance and REST endpoint response times. \n\n    In case of issues, troubleshooting steps include checking application logs for error messages, restarting problematic Wildfly instances, and checking for Kafka performance problems. \n\n    Overall, the Kafka mirroring implementation provides a robust and redundant system for the Online Banking system, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime in case of failures or maintenance activities.",

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n2.

Restart Streamsets\n   ```bash\n   cluster -> Streamsets -> Restart\n   ```\n4.

You can also try to kill (use Cloudera Manager or yarn command) and then re-submit the topology.\n## Batch\n### Main script\nAs mentioned before, the information processed by the [Prod_IBANK_IngestStream](#prod_ibank_ingeststream) topology is stored in Kudu/HBase tables. At the end of each day (at **1:00 am in PR site** and **2:00 am in DR site** by **Cron**) the records from HBase/Kudu is enriched with additional information and the transfered to a parquet table. After the data are inserted to the parquet table, sequent jobs are triggered to produce aggregations and data for external systems. This procedure runs **independantly on both sites**.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n```\n## Troubleshooting\nFollowing troubleshooting steps apply to all pipelines.\n**Step 1:** Log in to [Stremsets](https://un2.bigdata.abc.gr:18636/) with `sdc` user.\n1. Check that the specific pipeline has the status `RUNNING`. If it has any other status continue the investigation.   \n1. Open a pipeline. Check the generic summary (click anywhere in the board and select summary) to get an overview through dashboards on the data processed and errors. Also check if any job of the pipeline has errors (click on an action box and select tab Errors). Streamset will provide a specific ERROR message.\n**Step 2:** Look at the `logs`.\n**TO VIEW THE LOG FILE FOR A SPECIFIC PIPELINE:** `cat sdc.log | grep -i '<pipeline-grep-keyword>'`\n1. Through the `Stramsets UI`, `logs` can be viewed by pressing the paper icon (second) on the top right corner of the selected pipeline environment.\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files\nThe source system in this case is NNM. For high availability there are two instances of NNM on two seperate servers and they operate in active-standby fashion. The whole infrastructure is entirely managed by abc. The raw files produced contain component metrics for CPU load and memory usage of the network elements and are stored in local paths on those servers.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Service: NNM <br> Host: nnmprd01.abc.gr] --> B[File: BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz <br> Path: /var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final <br> Host: nnmprd01.abc.gr]\n  C[Service: NNM <br> Host: nnmdis01.abc.gr] -.->|Stopped| D[File: BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz <br> Path: /var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final <br> Host: nnmdis01.abc.gr]\n```\n**Path**: `/var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final` on `nnmprd01.abc.gr` or `nnmdis01.abc.gr`",

The instructions cover essential steps such as ensuring the system time is correct, deactivating the existing license, activating the new license, restarting RStudio Connect, and verifying the activation.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the chatbot response contains some redundant information and commands. For instance, the response includes multiple instances of setting the system time and timezone, which could be condensed into a single step for clarity and efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, the chatbot response does not provide any explicit guidance on how to obtain or retrieve the new license key (<product-key>) required for activation. This omission could potentially lead to confusion or difficulties for users who are not familiar with the process of obtaining or retrieving license keys.\n\n### **Score:** \nBased on the detailed assessment provided above, I would give the chatbot response a score of 4 out of 5. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the steps required to renew an expired RStudio Connect license. However, the response could be improved by condensing redundant information and commands, providing explicit guidance on how to obtain or retrieve the new license key, and ensuring that all

The instructions are detailed and include specific commands to be executed, which suggests that the chatbot has a good understanding of the technical aspects involved in renewing the license.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that some parts of the response seem somewhat generic or not entirely tailored to the specific query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license. For instance, steps related to fixing timezone, date, and time settings, while potentially relevant in a broader troubleshooting context, may not be directly pertinent to the primary task of renewing the license.\n\nDespite these observations, it's crucial to acknowledge that the chatbot response does indeed address the core question posed by the user.

Use tools like Impala's Query Log or Cloudera Manager's Query Analysis feature to analyze query patterns.\n3. **Adjust resource allocation**: Based on your analysis, adjust the resource allocation for Impala. This may involve increasing the number of Impala daemons, adjusting the memory allocation for each daemon, or optimizing the storage layout for Impala tables.\n4. **Implement connection pooling**: Implement connection pooling to reduce the overhead of establishing and closing connections. This can be done using tools like Apache Hive's Connection Pooling feature or third-party libraries like Apache Commons DBCP.\n5. **Monitor and adjust**: Continuously monitor Impala performance and adjust your configuration as needed to ensure optimal performance.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and optimize Impala performance in the face of concurrent client connections.",

The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2.

Unreachable Impala deamon.\n[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n# Failure Handling\n## Logs\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`",

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\n...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.
