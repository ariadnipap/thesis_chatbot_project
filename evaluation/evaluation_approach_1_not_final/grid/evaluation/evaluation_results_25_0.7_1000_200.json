First, check the current configuration:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'grep \"^PermitRootLogin\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config'\n```\nThen, modify the configuration to disallow root login:\n```bash\nsed -i -e 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\nApply the changes using:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.script salt://disable_root_login.sh\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'service sshd reload'\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To prevent root SSH login on all servers, you can modify the SSH configuration file to disable root login. This can be done by adding or modifying the following line in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:\n    ```\n    PermitRootLogin no\n    ```\n    After making this change, you will need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the following command:\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl restart sshd\n    ```\n    Alternatively, you can also use the following command to reload the SSH configuration without restarting the service:\n    ```\n    sudo systemctl reload sshd\n    ``` \n    Note: The above commands and file paths are based on a Linux system using systemd. The exact commands and file paths may vary depending on your specific system configuration.\n    To apply this change to all servers, you can use a configuration management tool like Ansible or Puppet to push the updated SSH configuration file to all servers and restart the SSH service. Alternatively, you can also use a script to automate the process of updating the SSH configuration file and restarting the SSH service on all servers. \n    Here is an example of how you can use Ansible to update the SSH configuration file and restart the SSH service on all servers:\n    ```\n    ---\n    - name: Update SSH configuration and restart SSH service\n      hosts: all_servers\n      become: yes\n      tasks:\n        - name: Update SSH configuration file\n          copy:\n            content: |\n              PermitRootLogin no\n            dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n            mode: '0644'\n        - name: Restart SSH service\n          service:\n            name: sshd\n            state: restarted\n    ```\n    This Ansible playbook updates the SSH configuration file to disable root login and restarts the SSH service on all servers. You can modify the playbook to fit your specific needs and environment.\n    I hope this helps!

The instruction to prevent root SSH login on all servers is addressed directly in the response, which provides a clear and step-by-step guide on how to achieve this.\n\nThe response starts by explaining that to prevent root SSH login, one needs to modify the SSH configuration file to disable root login. This is achieved by adding or modifying the line `PermitRootLogin no` in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.\n\nAfter making this change, the response instructs to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect. This can be done by running the command `sudo systemctl restart sshd`.\n\nThe response also provides an alternative method using Ansible to update the SSH configuration file and restart the SSH service on all servers.\n\nOverall, the chatbot's response is comprehensive, well-structured, and directly addresses the user's question.

From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n      tar -ztvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz | grep -i mysql_backup # List contents of the tar.gz file.Under backup folder stored tar.gz files from daily backup procedure,for both sites, with the format CLUSTER_year-month-day.tar.gz (e.g DRBDA_2022-03-21.tar.gz).

Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n# TeMIP\n## Overview\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\n- **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour.

        "chatbot_answer": " To create a Kerberos keytab file for user authentication, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Login to the kerb1 node as root**: Use SSH to connect to the kerb1 node and switch to the root user using `sudo -i`.\n2.  **Use the command-line interface to the Kerberos administration system**: Run the command `kadmin.local` to access the Kerberos administration system.\n3.  **Check if there is a principal for the corresponding username**: Use the command `listprincs <username>@CNE.abc.GR` to check if a principal exists for the specified username.\n4.  **Create a principal if there is not one**: If no principal exists, create one using the command `addprinc <username>@CNE.abc.GR`.\n5.  **Create the keytab**: Finally, create the keytab file using the command `ktadd -k /tmp/<username>.keytab -norandkey <username>@CNE.abc.GR`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a Kerberos keytab file for user authentication.\n\n**Additional Steps:**\n\nAfter creating the keytab file, you may need to copy it to another location or node, depending on your specific use case.\n\nFor example, if you need to use the keytab file on a different node, you can copy it using the `scp` command:\n\n```bash\nscp -p /tmp/<username>.keytab un2:/tmp\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `<username>` with the actual username and `un2` with the actual hostname or IP address of the destination node.\n\nAdditionally, after copying the keytab file, you may need to set the correct ownership and permissions on the file. This can typically be done using the `chown` and `chmod` commands:\n\n```bash\nchown skokkoris. /home/users/skokkoris/<username>.keytab\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `<username>` with the actual username and adjust the path and ownership as needed to match your specific use case.\n\nBy following these additional steps, you can ensure that the keytab file is properly copied, owned, and permissioned for use in your Kerberos authentication setup.",

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n3.

Just delete the `testuser`.\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3. Check the new user and from the right bar click `delete this entry`\n# For Case 2 follow the below steps:\nIdentify which `kerb` ldap instance has the issue. For example check if they had the same ammount of `users` and `groups` with `ldapsearch` commands from checks\nFrom the `kerb` ldap instance without corruption :\n```bash\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### A brief history of errors\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n**Kerberos Principal Configuration:** `/app/conf/application.yaml` -> `hdfsput.kerberos.principal`\n## Metrics\n| Requirement                         | Metric                          | Metric OID                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\nservice=\"kafka\";\n    };\n    ```\n3.

The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1.

Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\nB --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1.

If errors like 'connection refused' appear, try deleting the failing pod using `kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>`. If it remains in a 'Terminating' state, restart the Docker Daemon Worker from Cloudera Manager (`Cloudera Manager -> CDSW -> Docker Daemon Worker -> Restart`) and restart the CDSW application (`Cloudera Manager -> CDSW -> Application Role -> Restart`).

However, based on the general troubleshooting steps and procedures outlined for other services, it can be inferred that a similar approach might be applicable. This could involve stopping and restarting relevant services, checking logs for error messages, and potentially reconfiguring settings related to Spark port forwarding. Nevertheless, without specific guidance or documentation on CDSW service restart procedures in the context of Spark port forwarder issues, any attempts to troubleshoot or resolve such problems should be approached with caution and ideally in consultation with qualified support personnel or official Cloudera documentation resources.",

After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same.

Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```",

Check the log files located at `/shared/sdc/log/sdc.log`. You can use `grep` or open the log file with `less sdc.log` and search for specific keywords.\n3. Apply filters to retrieve information related to the specific pipeline. You can use commands like `cat sdc.log | grep -i 'Started reading file'`.\n4. Check the log retention period, which is set to 10 days.

Check that the specific pipeline has the status `RUNNING`. If it has any other status continue the investigation.   \n1. Open a pipeline. Check the generic summary (click anywhere in the board and select summary) to get an overview through dashboards on the data processed and errors. Also check if any job of the pipeline has errors (click on an action box and select tab Errors). Streamset will provide a specific ERROR message.\n**Step 2:** Look at the `logs`.\n**TO VIEW THE LOG FILE FOR A SPECIFIC PIPELINE:** `cat sdc.log | grep -i '<pipeline-grep-keyword>'`\n1.

Through the `Stramsets UI`, `logs` can be viewed by pressing the paper icon (second) on the top right corner of the selected pipeline environment.\n1. Open `logs` and apply some filters in order to retrieve the information related to the specific pipeline. Logs can be found at `/shared/sdc/log/sdc.log`. To search logs use `grep` or open log file with `less sdc.log` and search `'/'`.\n    1. Grep for `Started reading file` to see when a new file is parsed successfully:\n        ```\n        cat sdc.log | grep -i 'Started reading file'\n        ```\n        > 2022-03-22 14:00:03,419 [user:\\*sdc] [pipeline:energy_efficiency basebandsouth RET TEST/energyeffd112ecef-f20d-45ff-bef4-b88f2117e3d7] [runner:] [thread:ProductionPipelineRunnable-energyeffd112ecef-f20d-45ff-bef4-b88f2117e3d7-energy_efficiency basebandsouth RET TEST] INFO  RemdefDownloadSource - **Started reading file**: /basebandsouth_RET_20220322-092713.csv\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | FAILED  | com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.AppEmptyQueryException | 2023-05-10 07:05:02.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=1                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:05:22.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS |                                                                            | 2023-05-10 07:05:35.000 |\n+-------------+-----+------------+---------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+\n4 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n```\nAccording to the above results, we conclude that the computation of the QOS metrics for the selected 5min interval failed on the first attempt with AppEmptyQueryException error.

In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n## Procedure\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)",

This includes checking current table statistics using Impala, recomputing statistics if they are missing, refreshing the table if errors persist, and finally verifying data flow and logs for potential loading issues.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 2**\n\nThe chatbot response does not directly address how to resolve missing statistics warnings in `sai.voice_quality_hist`, providing instead a series of steps that may be tangentially related but do not offer a clear, step-by-step solution to the specific problem at hand. In contrast, the reference answer provides a direct, relevant, and well-articulated approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, based on the scoring criteria provided, the chatbot response warrants a score of 2, indicating that it is mostly incorrect or contains major factual errors.",

The error has to do with HBase merging/spliting on a region server, but a detailed reason is unknown.\n# Benchmarking HBASE on Lab with YCSB Tool\n## Introduction\nOur purpose was to run performance tests on a created Hbase table on Lab environment and document the results which will be used as a point of reference to evaluate the efficacy of quotas that will be applied. After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n**Alerts**:\n- Retention IbankCleanupHbaseSAS JOB\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n- After the root cause for the failure is resolved, check on `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/no_bkp/duplicate_cid_hbase` if a manual re-run must be done for a specific date\n  - For a specified date eg 2022-06-30:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_tools_cleanupHbaseSAS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_STREAM LIST 20220630\n    ```\n##  Oozie Jobs\n###  Lookup tables\nEvery day (at 07:15 by Oozie on DR & PR site ), we transfers 3 tables with reference data from the legacy MSSQL server, which is managed by mno, to the cluster. We keep only latest version to BigData (no partition).\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Coordinator**: `Coord_IbankLookupTables_PROD`\n**Workflow**: `ImportLookupTables`\n**Local path**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/hdfs_mirror/lookupTables/import_lookup_tables.sh`\n**Logs**: from HUE\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors. You can also try to kill (use Cloudera Manager or yarn command) and then re-submit the topology.\n## Batch\n### Main script\nAs mentioned before, the information processed by the [Prod_Online_IngestStream](#prod_online_ingeststream) topology is stored in Kudu/HBase tables. At the end of each day (at **4:15 am in PR & DR site** by **Cron**) the records from HBase/Kudu is enriched with additional information and the transfered to a parquet table. After the data are inserted to the parquet table, sequent jobs are triggered to produce aggregations and data for external systems. This procedure runs **independantly on both sites**.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/online_daily_batch_jobs.log`\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors. You can also try to kill (use Cloudera Manager or yarn command) and then re-submit the topology.\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible\n**Visible transaction**: Visible are considered transactions from applications that have show_customer marked as true in the Impala table `prod_trlog_ibank.service_name`.\nThis topology takes **visible** records from the final Kafka topics and writes them to HBase tables. This topology runs independently **on both clusters**.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream] --> C[Spark: Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible]\n  B[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_name] -->|Queried every 6 hours| C[Spark: Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible]\n  C --> D[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT]\n  C --> E[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_CLUN_APP]\n  C --> F[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_ID]",

We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\nmode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka2 999.999.999.999:9093\nlisten viavi-megafeed-kafka3_ssl\n   bind 999.999.999.999:9093\n   mode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka3 999.999.999.999:9093\n```\n## Procedure\n### Manage HAProxy\nStart - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl start haproxy\n```\nStop - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl stop haproxy\n```\nCheck - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl status haproxy\nss -tulnp | grep 9093 # Check listening port\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 3\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 3\n```\n### Manage DNS entries\nLogin to [IDM](https://admin.bigdata.abc.gr/ipa/ui/) with an administrative account to manage DNS entries\nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt;

        "ground_truth": "Kafka mirroring is implemented using Kafka MirrorMaker. Each site produces messages to a topic with the `-mir` suffix, which is then mirrored to the final topic without the suffix. PR and DR sites use MirrorMakers at specific nodes (e.g., `pr1node01.mno.gr` for PR and `dr1node01.mno.gr` for DR) to replicate data between sites, ensuring redundancy.",
        "chatbot_answer": " Kafka mirroring is implemented using MirrorMaker, which replicates traffic from the Primary Site Mirror Topics to the Disaster Site Final Topics. This ensures that both sites have a copy of all messages, providing redundancy and failover capabilities for the Online Banking system.\n\n    Additionally, there are two separate Spark Streaming topologies, one for Prod_Online_IngestStream and another for Prod_IBANK_IngestStream. These topologies consume records from the final Kafka topics, extract values, and write them to Kudu tables or HBase tables.\n\n    The MirrorMaker implementation uses consumer groups mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001 and mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002, with offsets committed to the Primary Site Kafka cluster and Disaster Site Kafka cluster, respectively. \n\n    Overall, the Kafka mirroring implementation provides a robust and fault-tolerant system for the Online Banking application, ensuring that data is always available and up-to-date across both sites.",
        "retrieved_context": "# Manage Kafka MirrorMaker\n## Scope\nKafka MirrorMaker has been configured with auto.offsets.reset=false. This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n## Setup\n1.

For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n7. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n8.

        "question": "How do you change the domain in RStudio Connect?",
        "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
        "ground_truth": "Backup the current configuration, update `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg` with new LDAP settings, and restart the service with `systemctl restart rstudio-connect`.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To change the domain in RStudio Connect, you need to update the configuration file `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`. Specifically, you need to change the `ServerAddress` field to point to the new domain. Additionally, you may need to update other fields such as `UserSearchBaseDN`, `GroupSearchBaseDN`, and `PermittedLoginGroup` to match the new domain's configuration. After updating the configuration file, you need to restart RStudio Connect for the changes to take effect. \n\n    It is also important to note that changing the domain in RStudio Connect may require additional steps such as updating the SSL certificates, configuring the firewall rules, and notifying the users about the change. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully review the documentation and consult with the support team if necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new domain. \n\n    Additionally, you should also update the `rstudio-connect.gcfg` file to reflect the changes in the domain. This includes updating the `ServerAddress`, `UserSearchBaseDN`, `GroupSearchBaseDN`, and `PermittedLoginGroup` fields to match the new domain's configuration. \n\n    After updating the `rstudio-connect.gcfg` file, you should restart RStudio Connect for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the command `systemctl restart rstudio-connect`. \n\n    Once RStudio Connect has been restarted, you should verify that the changes have taken effect by checking the RStudio Connect logs and verifying that users can log in successfully. \n\n    If you encounter any issues during the process of changing the domain in RStudio Connect, you should consult the RStudio Connect documentation and seek support from the RStudio Connect community or a qualified support specialist. \n\n    In summary, changing the domain in RStudio Connect requires updating the `rstudio-connect.gcfg` file to reflect the changes in the domain, restarting RStudio Connect for the changes to take effect, and verifying that the changes have taken effect by checking the RStudio Connect logs and verifying that users can log in successfully. \n\n    It is also important to note that changing the domain in RStudio Connect may require additional steps such as updating the SSL certificates, configuring the firewall rules, and notifying the users about the change. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully review the documentation and consult with the support team if necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new domain. \n\n    Finally, it is also important to note that changing the domain in RStudio Connect may have implications for other systems or applications that integrate with RStudio Connect. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully review the documentation and consult with the support team if necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new domain and to minimize any potential disruptions to other systems or applications. \n\n    In conclusion, changing the domain in RStudio Connect requires careful planning, attention to detail, and a thorough understanding of the implications of such a change. By following the steps outlined in this response and carefully reviewing the documentation and consulting with the support team if necessary, you should be able to successfully change the domain in RStudio Connect and minimize any potential disruptions to other systems or applications. \n\n    I hope this helps!

Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\nn_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/hbase2\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads\nhttps://blog.cloudera.com/hbase-performance-testing-using-ycsb/\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)",

The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### Ingestion Endpoint\n[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n```\n3.

        "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot response provides a step-by-step guide on how to renew an expired RStudio Connect license. The instructions are detailed and include specific commands to be executed, which suggests that the chatbot has a good understanding of the technical aspects involved in renewing the license.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that some parts of the response seem somewhat generic or not entirely tailored to the specific query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license. For instance, steps related to fixing timezone, date, and time settings, while potentially relevant in a broader troubleshooting context, may not be directly pertinent to the primary task of renewing the license.\n\nDespite these observations, it's crucial to acknowledge that the chatbot response does indeed address the core question posed by the user. The instructions provided are clear, actionable, and directly related to the process of renewing an expired RStudio Connect license.\n\n### **Feedback:**\nGiven the detailed nature of the chatbot's response and its direct relevance to the query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license, I would argue that the response is largely on target. However, the inclusion of certain steps that might be considered tangential to the primary task of license renewal does slightly detract from the overall focus and efficiency of the response.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 4\n\nThis score reflects the chatbot's ability to provide a detailed, step-by-step guide that directly addresses the user's query about renewing an expired RStudio Connect license.

        "chatbot_answer": " To verify the number of exported Location Mobility records, you can check the reconciliation files produced for each type of file (e.g., LM_02_lte, LM_03_smsIn, etc.). These reconciliation files contain information on the date of execution, the name of the file, the export date, and the number of lines it contains. By checking these reconciliation files, you can verify the number of exported Location Mobility records for each type of file. \n\n    Additionally, you can also check the log files produced by the scripts that export the Location Mobility data. These log files contain information on the execution of the scripts, including any errors or issues that may have occurred during the export process. By checking these log files, you can gain insight into the export process and verify that the expected number of Location Mobility records were exported.\n\n    It's also worth noting that if you need to export files for a specific date, you can execute the script with the `-t <yyyymmdd>` flag. For example, if you want to export the first 6 files for the 13th of March 2022, you can run the script with the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh -t 20220313 --max-files 6 >> /shared/abc/location_mobility/log/lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1\n    ```\n    This will instruct the script to catch-up, meaning to export files for the specified date. The `--max-files` flag specifies the maximum number of files to export.\n\n    By following these steps and using the provided commands, you can verify the number of exported Location Mobility records and ensure that the expected data is being exported correctly. \n\n    Please let me know if I can assist further!",

If queries are stalled, cancel them from `Cloudera > Impala > Queries`.\n3. Restart the Impala daemon on affected nodes.\n4. If the issue persists, analyze memory usage and consider redistributing workload across nodes.\nThese steps ensure that Impala recovers from heavy client loads and resumes processing efficiently.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To troubleshoot performance degradation in Impala caused by concurrent client connections, follow these steps:\n1. **Monitor Impala logs**: Check the Impala logs for any error messages or warnings related to concurrent client connections.\n2. **Check Impala metrics**: Use tools like Cloudera Manager or Impala's built-in metrics to monitor the number of concurrent client connections, query latency, and other relevant metrics.\n3. **Adjust Impala configuration**: Based on the analysis of logs and metrics, adjust Impala's configuration settings, such as the number of concurrent queries allowed, query timeout settings, or memory allocation settings.\n4. **Implement connection pooling**: Consider implementing connection pooling mechanisms, such as using a connection pool library or configuring Impala to use a connection pool, to reduce the overhead of establishing and closing connections.\n5. **Monitor and adjust**: Continuously monitor Impala's performance and adjust the configuration settings as needed to ensure optimal performance.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and address performance degradation issues in Impala caused by concurrent client connections.",

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\n...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n### Alert Mail\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails.

Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | FAILED  | com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.AppEmptyQueryException | 2023-05-10 07:05:02.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=1                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:05:22.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS |                                                                            | 2023-05-10 07:05:35.000 |\n+-------------+-----+------------+---------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+\n4 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n```\nAccording to the above results, we conclude that the computation of the QOS metrics for the selected 5min interval failed on the first attempt with AppEmptyQueryException error.
