        "retrieved_context": "# Fix Mysql Replication\n## Scope\nSometimes there are invalid MySQL queries which cause the replication to not work anymore. In this short guide, it explained how you can repair the replication on the MySQL slave. This guide is for MySQL.\n### Glossary\n- MYSQL replication: It is a process that enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to copied automatically to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)\n## Setup\n### Mysql Instances\n#### PR\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n#### DR\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `dr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `dr1node02.mno.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n## Procedure\n### Identify the problem\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n      ```\n2. If one of `Slave_IO_Running` or `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`, then the replication is broken\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n      tar -ztvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz | grep -i mysql_backup # List contents of the tar.gz file.Under backup folder stored tar.gz files from daily backup procedure,for both sites, with the format CLUSTER_year-month-day.tar.gz (e.g DRBDA_2022-03-21.tar.gz).

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n### Force replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n## Troubleshooting\n### Move users to the created domain\n1. Back up mysql SSO_USERS table:\n```bash\nmysqldump -u root  -p test_r_cpe SSO_USERS --single-transaction > /tmp/SSO_USERS_BACKUP.sql\n```\n2. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\nmysql> use test_r_cpe;\nmysql> show tables;\nmysql> select * FROM SSO_DOMAINS LIMIT 5; #newly domain_ID is 5\nmysql> show create table SSO_USERS; #Domain_ID is currently 3\nmysql> UPDATE SSO_USERS SET DOMAIN_ID=5 WHERE DOMAIN_ID=3;\nmysql> select * FROM SSO_USERS where DOMAIN_ID=5;\n```\n### Domain Deletion\n1. Login with a user authorized with SSO access rights on the application\n2. On the main screen select User Management on the left of the page\n3. Select Domain from the tabs on the left\n4. Select the domain you want to delete by clicking on the left of the record\n5. Select Delete Row(s) button at the bottom of the view.\n6.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\nB -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1.

If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n- **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n### Alert Mail\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n1.

The applications that handle the HTTP calls are installed on the edge servers of both sites. At normal operation only one site is active. These applications are deployed on top of Wildfly instances. There are four sets of Wildfly installations one for the `ibank` flow and one for the `online` flow and two others for applications developed by mno. All application servers are managed by `supervisord` owned by `root` user.\n**DEV/QA Information**:\nThe information below are written for the Production enviroment. There is a development/QA environment that runs only on DR site. In case of a problem the paths are exectly the same if you substitute the `prod` with the `dev` preffix. For the networking part of the DEV/QA environment use the [Network Information](#network-information) chapter\n### Glossary\n- NetScaler: Loadbalancer managed by mno. It handles SSL offloading\n- VIP: Virtual IP of the Loadbalancer\n- SNIP: IP of the Loadbalancer that initiates the connection to Wildfly instances\n- Health check: Endpoint that the Loadbalancer uses to determine if a specific Wildfly instance is active. It expects a `HTTP 200/OK` response\n## Setup\n### Internet Banking Wildfly Instances\n#### prodrestib\nHandles ingestion and queries for the Internet Banking (`ibank`) flow.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Port**: `8080`\n**Health Check Endpoint**: `/trlogibank/app`\n**Supervisor Configuration**: `/etc/supervisor.d/wildfly-prodrestib.ini`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n- The data in the Hourly tables is only for the current day. No need to fill missing hours, as the next MergeBatch will insert the data to the final table.\n## Queries\nThe ingested data are queried in order to be displayed by the Internet Banking application (under the Calendar/\u0397\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf application).

This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### A brief history of errors\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n- **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n- **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1.

Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1.

Verify that SparkPortForwarder is operational by checking logs with `kubectl logs <spark-forwarder-pod> -n <namespace>` and confirming successful port forwarding entries.",
        "chatbot_answer": " The correct way to restart Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW) services when jobs fail due to Spark port forwarder issues is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on general troubleshooting practices for CDSW and Spark, it can be inferred that restarting the affected services might help resolve the issue.\n\n    To do this, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Affected Services**: Determine which specific services (e.g., Spark, Livy, etc.) are experiencing issues due to the Spark port forwarder problems.\n\n2. **Stop the Services**: Once you have identified the affected services, stop them using the appropriate commands or through the Cloudera Manager interface if available.\n\n3. **Restart the Services**: After stopping the services, restart them in the correct order (if there are dependencies between services). This can usually be done using the same methods as for stopping the services.\n\n4. **Verify Service Status and Job Execution**: Finally, verify that all services have started successfully and that jobs can now execute without encountering Spark port forwarder issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to restart the necessary CDSW services and resolve the job failures caused by Spark port forwarder problems.",

After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n# Kubernetes User Environment Setup\n## Tools\nThe main tool that needs to be installed is **kubectl**, instructions for which can be found\n[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/). Additionally after\ninstallation, completion can be enabled by executing:\n```bash\nmkdir -p /etc/bash_completion.d\nkubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl\n```\nIf possible a nice to have plugin for setting up kubeconfigs can be found at\n[kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin](https://github.com/superbrothers/kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin/releases). Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the (instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing hte following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n### Check signed certificates from mno\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n- Check the issuer\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n- Check the subject\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this:\n# GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords\n- [GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords](#groupnet---change-bind-users-passwords)\n  - [RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind](#ranai-geolocation---t1-svc-cneranaibind)\n  - [R-Studio Connect - t1-svc-cnebind](#r-studio-connect---t1-svc-cnebind)\n    - [Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect)\nThe purpose of this document is to describe the procedure on how to change the passwords for the bind users used for querying the LDAP of GROUPNET domain.\n## RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind\n1.

This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### A brief history of errors\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash",

This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### A brief history of errors\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n- **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically.

The application runs in a Kubernetes pod. [Monitoring App](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/common-dev/apps/monitoring/monitoring-devops/-/wikis/home#prod) is used for monitoring and health checks.\n**Pod User:** `root`  \n**Pod Scheduler:** `Cron`  \n**Kubernetes Namespace** `piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-deployment`  \n**Cluster User** `ipvpn`  \n**Container Registry** `kubemaster-vip.bigdata.abc.gr/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-app`  \n**Schedule:** `Every 5 minutes`  \n**Pod Script:** `/app/run_vdsl2.sh`  \n**Main Configuration File:** `/app/conf/application.yaml`  \n**Logs:** Use `kubectl logs` to view `stdout`  \n**Hadoop Table:** `bigcust.vdsl2`\n## Application Components\n### SNMP Polling of Elements\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request.

The applications that handle the HTTP calls are installed on the edge servers of both sites. At normal operation only one site is active. These applications are deployed on top of Wildfly instances. There are four sets of Wildfly installations one for the `ibank` flow and one for the `online` flow and two others for applications developed by mno. All application servers are managed by `supervisord` owned by `root` user.\n**DEV/QA Information**:\nThe information below are written for the Production enviroment. There is a development/QA environment that runs only on DR site. In case of a problem the paths are exectly the same if you substitute the `prod` with the `dev` preffix. For the networking part of the DEV/QA environment use the [Network Information](#network-information) chapter\n### Glossary\n- NetScaler: Loadbalancer managed by mno. It handles SSL offloading\n- VIP: Virtual IP of the Loadbalancer\n- SNIP: IP of the Loadbalancer that initiates the connection to Wildfly instances\n- Health check: Endpoint that the Loadbalancer uses to determine if a specific Wildfly instance is active. It expects a `HTTP 200/OK` response\n## Setup\n### Internet Banking Wildfly Instances\n#### prodrestib\nHandles ingestion and queries for the Internet Banking (`ibank`) flow.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Port**: `8080`\n**Health Check Endpoint**: `/trlogibank/app`\n**Supervisor Configuration**: `/etc/supervisor.d/wildfly-prodrestib.ini`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\n#### prodrestibmetrics\nHosts applications developed by mno and accessed by the Internet Banking backend servers. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Port**: `8081`\n**Health Check Endpoint**: `/ibankmetrics/app`\n**Supervisor Configuration**: `/etc/supervisor.d/wildfly-prodrestibmetrics.ini`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `Managed by mno`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestibmetrics/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestibmetrics/access.log`\n### Internet Banking Loadbalancer farms\nThere are two active Loadbalancers for Internet Banking.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n### Main Application\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n- **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n### Alert Mail\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n## Manual Actions\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1.

Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n### Move Kudu to Impala\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\nsh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 20230104 \"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\"\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\n        ``` sql\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\n        \"Terminated-Oracle\" state,\n        \"Closed\" problem_status,\n        case when clearancereportflag = \"1\" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\n        handledby as handled_by,\n        closedby as closed_by,\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\n        null previous_state,\n1. Press the `Edit` option below the table\n1. Select the desired `Level` between the given options. \n1. Click `Save`\n1. Ssh from `un2` with `temip` to `temip1` or `temip2` with `temip` user and check that in the file `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml` the level of the previously configured logger has changed successfully. It should be configured **automatically**. \n## Useful Links\n- [TeMIP Dir](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/temip)\n- [TeMIP Application Deployment](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/temip/temip-devops/-/wikis/Application-Deployment)\n- [TeMIP Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/temip/temip-devops/-/wikis/home)",

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n# Manage HBase Quotas\n## Enable HBase quotas\n1. Go to ```Cloudera Manager => HBase => Configuration => HBase Service Advanced configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml```\n2. Add the following configuration:\n   ```\n   Name: hbase.quota.enabled\n   Value: true\n   Description: enable hbase quotas\n   ```\n3. Restart HBase service\n## Add HBase quotas to a namespace\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n   ```bash\n   cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\n   ls \u2013ltr HBASE\n   cd <latest hbase process folder>\n   kinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n   ```\n3. Get list of namespaces\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   list_namespace\n   ```\n4. Set throttle READ quotas \n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => \u2018namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n   ```\n5. Set throttle WRITE quotas\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => \u2018namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n   ```\n6. Show all quotas\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   list_quotas\n   ```\n## Remove HBase quotas from a namespace\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n   ```bash\n   cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\n   ls \u2013ltr HBASE\n   cd <latest hbase process folder>\n   kinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n   ```\n3. Get list of namespaces and list of quotas already set\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   list_namespace\n   list_quotas\n   ```\n4. Delete throttle quotas\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => \u2018namespace', LIMIT => NONE\n   ```\n5. Verify that quotas have been removed\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   list_quotas\n   ```\n**User**: `DEVREST`\n**Script Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/DEVREST/common/log/retention_mechanism_daily.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/common/scripts/retention_mechanism_daily_STABLE.sh`\n**Alerts**:\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n- After the root cause for the failure is resolved, run manually the following command\n  ``` bash  \n  /opt/ingestion/DEVREST/common/scripts/retention_mechanism_daily_STABLE.sh >> /var/log/ingestion/DEVREST/common/log/retention_mechanism_daily.log 2>&1\n  ```\n### HBase retention\nEvery day (at **16:00 in both sites** by **Cron**) This script deletes rows from hbase `PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_STREAM` which refere to transactions inserted 7 days ago.

Check the access log for entries with large response time for the specific endpoint. If it is an isolated query the customer is not impacted.\n- Check application logs for error messages.\n- In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\n- If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Impala/Kudu/HBase.\n### Old implementation\nThere are two versions for each query. The old implementention queries Impala tables stored in both HDFS and Kudu/HBase. This implementation had performance problems for many concurrent users.\n**Endpoints**:\n- auditCount **NOT USED BY mno**\n- auditSearch **NOT USED BY mno**\n- selectById **USED BY mno**\n### New implementation\nThe new implementation uses a subset of the data (only visible transactions) stored in HBase.

The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n```\n- Check monitoring app for failed executions:  \n  \n  From `un2` with personal account:\n ``` bash\ncurl --location --request GET 'http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800/monitoring/api/jobstatus/find?application=DWHFIXED&job=DELTA$status=FAILED&operativePartition=<timestamp e.g.:20220518>'\n  ```\n - Get all the available fields [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/common-dev/apps/monitoring/monitoring-devops/-/wikis/API-Functional-Spec#fields)\n \n### 2.5.1.

Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\nIf it is not been imported, you should import them using formula  `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain so we can verify that the change is succesfully made. \nVaggos username in our case (enomikos)\n3. Customer should also send a bind user that we will use for groupnet domain configuration.\n4. `/etc/hosts` file at `un5` must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n5. Perfom an ldap search for the given bind user. \n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=enomikos)'\n```\n### Backup\n1.

Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2.

The instructions are detailed and cover various aspects, including finding the management IP address of the IDRAC, navigating to the IDRAC web interface, copying the Service Tag number, and contacting Dell support.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that some steps may not be directly relevant or necessary for creating a Dell support ticket. For instance, connecting to the node with the issue via ssh and then vnc (step 1) might not be essential for creating a support ticket. Similarly, finding the management IP address of the IDRAC using the command `ipmitool lan print | grep -i 'IP Address'` (step 2) could potentially be skipped if the user already has access to the IDRAC web interface.\n\nDespite these potential redundancies, the chatbot's response does provide a comprehensive and detailed guide on how to create a Dell support ticket for a hardware issue.

Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n7. Verify license status\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager status\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager verify\n    ```\n8. Restart R-Studio Connect\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl restart rstudio-connect\n    ```\n9. Check R-Studio Connect status\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n10.

Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n### Rstudio Lisence\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n### Delete user\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\nOutput must be something like below:\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n6.

Exiting..\n    ```\n    and `ps -ef | grep export_lm_voice_out_v2_mon.sh` return no process means the previous execution was forcefully stopped. Delete the lock file `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/voice_out.lock` and execute the script.\n**Ndefs**:\n- If files were missing the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded.  \nBefore manually executing the script in this case, check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log.\n- If 5 or more files weren't exported execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag. This will instruct the script to catch-up meaning to export files for N 2-hour intervals. This is not needed if 4 or less files were missed in which case the procedure will automatically catch up.

Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4.

Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n### Update configuration\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2.

Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2.

        "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
        "ground_truth": "Modify `haproxy.cfg` to include new brokers, restart HAProxy, and update DNS records in the cluster to map internal hostnames to Viavi Kafka brokers.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To configure Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer, you need to set up HAProxy configuration and manage DNS entries. The HAProxy configuration involves setting up a load balancer to distribute traffic between the Viavi Kafka brokers and the BigStreamer datanodes. The DNS entries need to be managed to ensure that the BigStreamer datanodes can resolve the hostnames of the Viavi Kafka brokers. Additionally, you need to configure the Spark Streaming application to consume data from the Viavi Kafka topics and write it to the BigStreamer HBase tables.\n    To achieve this connectivity, three new IPs (VLAN 300) were added to the Incelligent node, and hostnames from the Kafka Brokers were assigned to these internal IPs with DNS entries on the cluster's internal DNS. The reason for using only one node for connectivity is that the traffic from this flow can possibly saturate all uplinks of the BigStreamer, which would impact other flows.\n    To manage HAProxy, you need to start and stop the service as needed. You also need to check the status of the service and verify that it is listening on the correct port. Additionally, you need to use tools like `nc` to test connectivity to the HAProxy server.\n    To manage DNS entries, you need to log in to the IDM (Identity Management) system with an administrative account. From there, you can manage DNS entries for the BigStreamer cluster. You need to ensure that the DNS entries are correctly configured to allow the BigStreamer datanodes to resolve the hostnames of the Viavi Kafka brokers.\n    To commit consumer groups offsets for the PR site, you need to stop the Kafka MirrorMakers for the PR site and then use the `kafka-consumer-groups` command to commit the offsets for the consumer group. You need to ensure that the consumer group is inactive before attempting to commit the offsets.\n    To troubleshoot issues with the Spark Streaming application, you can check the application logs for any errors or exceptions. You can also use tools like `yarn` to check the status of the application and verify that it is running correctly. Additionally, you can try killing the application and then re-submitting it to see if that resolves the issue.\n    To troubleshoot issues with the HAProxy service, you can check the HAProxy logs for any errors or exceptions. You can also use tools like `systemctl` to check the status of the HAProxy service and verify that it is running correctly. Additionally, you can try restarting the HAProxy service to see if that resolves the issue.\n    To troubleshoot issues with the DNS entries, you can check the DNS logs for any errors or exceptions. You can also use tools like `dig` to test DNS resolution and verify that the DNS entries are correctly configured. Additionally, you can try updating the DNS entries to see if that resolves the issue. \nThe final answer is: \nTo configure Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer, set up HAProxy configuration and manage DNS entries. Ensure correct configuration of HAProxy and DNS entries to allow BigStreamer datanodes to resolve hostnames of Viavi Kafka brokers. Additionally, configure Spark Streaming application to consume data from Viavi Kafka topics and write it to BigStreamer HBase tables. To troubleshoot issues, check application logs for errors, use tools like `yarn` to check application status, and try killing and re-submitting the application.

Check the CDSW service status: You can do this by running the command `systemctl status cloudera-scm-server` on the CDSW server.\n\n2. Check the CDSW web interface: If the CDSW service is running, try accessing the CDSW web interface at `http://<CDSW_server>:7180`. Replace `<CDSW_server>` with the hostname or IP address of your CDSW server.\n\n3. Check the Cloudera Manager logs: If you are still unable to access the CDSW web interface, check the Cloudera Manager logs for any errors or issues related to CDSW. You can find the Cloudera Manager logs at `/var/log/cloudera-scm-server`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to determine the status of your CDSW instance and troubleshoot any issues that may be preventing it from running correctly.",

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\nn_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => WRITE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n-  Delete and recreate table to repeat to run tests with write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    n_splits = 300\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'write'\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_write_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/hbase2\n```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 #

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMAuthException\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1.

Business documents can be found [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/tree/master/docs).\n## Input Performance Data\nThere are two source systems, HP Network Node Manager (NNM) and SNMP Custom Poller application, that poll periodically network elements and produces raw files with the instantenous metrics. These files are then parsed by one or more procedures. Finally they are loaded to BigStreamer cluster in Impala tables. There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files\nThe source system in this case is NNM. For high availability there are two instances of NNM on two seperate servers and they operate in active-standby fashion. The whole infrastructure is entirely managed by abc.

After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9",

However, upon closer inspection, there are several discrepancies and inaccuracies in the provided instructions.\n\nFirstly, the initial steps involve logging into a specific server (`unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr`) as root via Cyberark. This level of specificity, including the domain name and the use of Cyberark for authentication, seems overly detailed and potentially irrelevant to the general process of renewing an RStudio Connect license.\n\nFurthermore, the instructions provided in the chatbot response differ significantly from those outlined in the reference answer. For example, the reference answer provides a clear, step-by-step guide that includes SSHing into the RStudio server, ensuring the system time is correct, deactivating the existing license, activating the new license, restarting RStudio Connect, and verifying the activation.\n\nIn contrast, the chatbot response includes steps such as logging into a specific server as root via Cyberark, running `timedatectl` and `hwclock -w` to ensure the system time is accurate and synced with the hardware clock. While these steps may be relevant in certain contexts, they do not align with the standard procedure for renewing an RStudio Connect license as outlined in the reference answer.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 2**\n\nThe chatbot response contains several inaccuracies and discrepancies compared to the reference answer. While it attempts to provide a step-by-step guide, the steps are not aligned with the standard procedure for renewing an RStudio Connect license.

Shutdown the Health Check endpoint:\n    - If you are in a call with mno, ask for a Network administrator to join the call\n    - Ask them to disable **gracefully** the server (mention the two Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to disable)\n    - If there is no one from mno's networking team and **only after communicating with mno**, use the following command:\n  \n      From the server as `PRODREST`:\n      ``` bash\n      curl -XPUT https://<hostname>:8080/trlogibank/app/app-disable\n      ```\n    - Check access logs to ensure no traffic is sent to the Wildfly\n2. Stop the Wildfly instance\n    From the server as `root`:\n    ``` bash\n    supervisorctl stop wildfly-prodrestib\n    ```\n3. Ensure that Wildfly is down\n    From the server as `root`:\n    ``` bash\n    ps -ef | grep 'prodrestib/'\n    supervisorctl status wildfly-prodrestib\n    tail -f /var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log\n    tail -f /var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log\n    ```\n### Stop a Wildfly instance - prodreston\n1.

The applications that handle the HTTP calls are installed on the edge servers of both sites. At normal operation only one site is active. These applications are deployed on top of Wildfly instances. There are four sets of Wildfly installations one for the `ibank` flow and one for the `online` flow and two others for applications developed by mno. All application servers are managed by `supervisord` owned by `root` user.\n**DEV/QA Information**:\nThe information below are written for the Production enviroment. There is a development/QA environment that runs only on DR site. In case of a problem the paths are exectly the same if you substitute the `prod` with the `dev` preffix. For the networking part of the DEV/QA environment use the [Network Information](#network-information) chapter\n### Glossary\n- NetScaler: Loadbalancer managed by mno. It handles SSL offloading\n- VIP: Virtual IP of the Loadbalancer\n- SNIP: IP of the Loadbalancer that initiates the connection to Wildfly instances\n- Health check: Endpoint that the Loadbalancer uses to determine if a specific Wildfly instance is active. It expects a `HTTP 200/OK` response\n## Setup\n### Internet Banking Wildfly Instances\n#### prodrestib\nHandles ingestion and queries for the Internet Banking (`ibank`) flow.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Port**: `8080`\n**Health Check Endpoint**: `/trlogibank/app`\n**Supervisor Configuration**: `/etc/supervisor.d/wildfly-prodrestib.ini`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`",

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n- Set throttle quotas of type 'read'\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'read'\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_read_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n```\n- Run the rest of the steps\n#### Upsert to HBase (Migration)\nThis step enriches the HBase visible tables with the transactions that are unique to MSSQL server.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit] --> C[Impala Insert/Spark]\n  B[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old] --> C\n  C --> D[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT]\n  C --> E[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_CLUN_APP]\n  C --> F[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_ID]\n  C --> G[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_CLUN_SNTRNCAT]\n  C --> H[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_OBSCURE]\n```\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Script Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`\n**Alerts**:\n- IBank_Migration Enrich hbase tables JOB\n- IBank_Migration Enrich hbase tables Impala_insert\n- IBank_Migration Enrich hbase tables Spark\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n  Ndef: If job failed and the following error appears :`ERROR: RetriesExhaustedWithDetailsException: Failed <num> actions: CallTimeoutException: <num> times, servers with issues: [dr/pr]1node02.mno.gr`,  execute script again.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\ngraph TD\n  A[Impala Table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist]\n  B[Computation of IF KPIs]\n  C[Impala Table: bigcust.interface_metrics]\n  A -->|Query|B\n  B -->|Load|C\n```\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Impala Table**: `bigcust.interface_metrics`\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/populate_interface_metrics_table.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/populate_interface_metrics_table.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log files e.g failed Impala query.\n## Output Configuration Data\nPeriodically an XML file that contains information about VPN customers with configuration changes, is produced by one of the Wildfly instances and is transferred to an exchange directory using a shell script.\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Wildfly <br> Host: unekl1.bigdata.abc.gr <br> Status: Master] -->| Executes | B[Script: /opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/ipvpnExports/sftp.sh <br> Host: unekl1.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: trustuser]\n  B -->|Export| C[File: SD_Inventory_DB_yyyy_mm_dd_HH:MM:SS.xml <br> Server: unekl1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  E[Wildfly <br> Host: unekl2.bigdata.abc.gr <br> Status: Slave] -.->| Executes | F[Script: /opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/ipvpnExports/sftp.sh <br> Host: unekl2.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: trustuser]\n  F -.->|Export| G[File: SD_Inventory_DB_yyyy_mm_dd_HH:MM:SS.xml <br> Server: unekl1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  C -->|SFTP| D[User: sd <br> Server: eeaadaptprd.def.gr <br> Path: /sd/classic/scripts/install/inventory/export/IPVPN_Inventory]\n  G -.->|SFTP| D\n```\n**User**: `trustuser`\n**Scheduler**: `Wildfly`\n**Schedule**: `Every 4 hours`\n**SFTP user**: `sd`\n**SFTP Server**: `eeaadaptprd.def.gr`\n**SFTP path**: `/sd/classic/scripts/install/inventory/export/IPVPN_Inventory`\n**Logs**: ```/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/log/server.log*```\n**Script**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/ipvpnExports/sftp.sh` on `unekl1.bigdata.abc.gr` and `unekl2.bigdata.abc.gr`",

You can use the `list_namespace` and `list_quotas` commands to check the current quotas and replication status.\n\n    It's also important to note that HBase replication is a complex process, and there are many factors that can affect its performance and reliability.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n# How to fix openldap replication\nThe broken replication between `kerb1`/`kerb2` could happened in case any of the below cases appeared/happened.\n- Case 1: You changed the `Manager` password of openldap instance\n- Case 2: Replication broken for any other reason (power outage etc) between `kerb1` and `kerb2`\nFor every ldasearch the password of `Manager` is [here](KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n# For Case 1 follow the below steps:\nLogin into kerb1 node as root\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\nBackup:\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif\nslapcat -n 2 -l data.ldif\n```\nCreate ldif file replication fix\n```bash\nvi replication_config.ldif\ndn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config\nchangetype:modify\nreplace: olcSyncrepl\nolcSyncrepl: rid=001\n  provider=ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=config\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=\"new password\"\n  searchbase=\"cn=config\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\nolcSyncrepl: rid=002\n  provider=ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=config\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=\"new password\"\n  searchbase=\"cn=config\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\nadd: olcMirrorMode\nolcMirrorMode: TRUE\ndn: olcDatabase={2}bdb,cn=config\nchangetype:modify\nreplace: olcSyncrepl\nolcSyncrepl: rid=003\n  provider=ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=`new password`\n  searchbase=\"dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\nolcSyncrepl: rid=004\n  provider=ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=`new password`\n  searchbase=\"dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\nadd: olcMirrorMode\nolcMirrorMode: TRUE\n```\nFix the replication:\n```bash\nldapmodify  -H ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=config\" -W -f replication_config.ldif\n```\n- Run the rest of the steps\n#### Upsert to HBase (Migration)\nThis step enriches the HBase visible tables with the transactions that are unique to MSSQL server.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit] --> C[Impala Insert/Spark]\n  B[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old] --> C\n  C --> D[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT]\n  C --> E[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_CLUN_APP]\n  C --> F[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_ID]\n  C --> G[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_CLUN_SNTRNCAT]\n  C --> H[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_OBSCURE]\n```\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Script Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`\n**Alerts**:\n- IBank_Migration Enrich hbase tables JOB\n- IBank_Migration Enrich hbase tables Impala_insert\n- IBank_Migration Enrich hbase tables Spark\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n  Ndef: If job failed and the following error appears :`ERROR: RetriesExhaustedWithDetailsException: Failed <num> actions: CallTimeoutException: <num> times, servers with issues: [dr/pr]1node02.mno.gr`,  execute script again.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n### Force replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n## Troubleshooting\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n## Troubleshooting\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n### A brief history of preauthentication\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### A brief history of errors\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\nkrbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes: REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes:\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n    Seems that preauthentication is enforced via `krbTicketFlags`. We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n    Now replication works.\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\n``` conf\n    Client {\n      com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\n      useKeyTab=false\n      useTicketCache=true\n      doNotPrompt=true\n      principal=\"kafka@BDAP.mno.GR\";\n    };\n    KafkaClient {\n      com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\n      useKeyTab=false\n      useTicketCache=true\n      doNotPrompt=true\n      principal=\"kafka@BDAP.mno.GR\"\n      service=\"kafka\";\n    };\n    ```\n3.

Exiting..\n    ```\n    and `ps -ef | grep export_lm_voice_out_v2_mon.sh` return no process means the previous execution was forcefully stopped. Delete the lock file `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/voice_out.lock` and execute the script.\n**Ndefs**:\n- If files were missing the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded.  \nBefore manually executing the script in this case, check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log.\n- If 5 or more files weren't exported execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag. This will instruct the script to catch-up meaning to export files for N 2-hour intervals. This is not needed if 4 or less files were missed in which case the procedure will automatically catch up. For example if 6 files were not exported run:\n    ``` bash\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log file e.g failed Impala query.\n- Find in the failed execution's log the message:\n    ``` logs\n    # e.g for 2022-01-10\n    Problem with 20220108.\n    ```\n    This means that table `sai.sub_aggr_csi_it` does not contain new data and therefore there is nothing to be done during this execution. Load table `sai.sub_aggr_csi_it` first and then execute the script.\n**Ndefs**:\n- If one date was missing the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded. Before manually executing the script in this case, check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log.\n- If you need to export file for a specific date execute the script with argument `<yyyymmdd>` flag. For example if file for 13th of March 2022 was not exported run:\n    ``` bash\n    /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/run/export_csi_mob_daily.sh 20220313 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.`date +%Y%m%d`.log 2>&1\n    ```\n- **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n### Alert Mail\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n``` bash\n  impala-shell -k --ssl -i ${HOSTNAME/01/} -q \"SET DDL_SYNC=true; refresh prod_trlog_ibank.historical_service_audit_v1;\"\n  ```\n- Run the rest of the steps\n#### Insert to Service Audit\nThis step transfers transactions migrated from the legacy MSSQL server to the final table.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.historical_service_audit_v1] -->|Impala Insert| B[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit]\n  ```\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Script Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_migrate_hist_to_service_audit.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_migrate_hist_to_service_audit_STABLE.sh` on `dr1edge01.mno.gr`/`pr1edge01.mno.gr` (each edge server submits to a different cluster)\n**Alerts**:\n- IBank_Migration Historical to SA JOB\n- IBank_Migration Historical to SA Impala_Insert\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n- The script cleans up after failure, so if the problem was temporary run the script again\n  - For the previous day:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_migrate_hist_to_service_audit_STABLE.sh prod_trlog_ibank.historical_service_audit_v1 prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit `date +%Y%m%d` 1 1 >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_migrate_hist_to_service_audit.log  2>&1\n    ```\n  - For a specified date:\n    ``` bash\n    # eg. 09-11-2019 (Ndef that the argument is one day after the desired date)\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_migrate_hist_to_service_audit_STABLE.sh prod_trlog_ibank.historical_service_audit_v1 prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit 20191110 1 1 >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_migrate_hist_to_service_audit.log  2>&1 &\n    ```\n- Run the rest of the steps\n#### Merge Batch\nThis step transfers transactions ingested by the [Stream](#stream) flow to an intermediate table and deletes the data from the original tables.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n```\n#### Duplicates between Impala and Kudu/HBase\nDelete data which exist both Impala and Kudu.

The command given seems to be a part of a larger query but lacks clarity on how it specifically checks for failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM.\n\nIn contrast, the reference answer provides a clear, well-structured MySQL query that directly addresses the task at hand. It specifies the selection criteria (application='IPVPN-SM', status='FAILED') and limits the results to the last day, making it a precise and efficient solution.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 2\n\nThe chatbot response is mostly incorrect due to its incompleteness and lack of direct relevance to the question asked. While it attempts to provide a MySQL query, it does not clearly or effectively address the task of checking failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM. Therefore, it scores low on the evaluation scale.",
        "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot's response is a MySQL query that appears to be related to checking failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM. The query seems complex and includes various table joins, date formatting, and conditionals.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that this query might not directly answer the user's question about the command to check failed executions. Instead, it provides a specific MySQL query that could be used to retrieve relevant information from the database.\n\nGiven the complexity of the query and its potential relevance to the user's question, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the response in terms of its accuracy, completeness, and overall usefulness in addressing the user's inquiry.\n\n### **Feedback:**\nThe chatbot's response is somewhat relevant but missing key elements. The provided MySQL query appears to be related to checking failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM. However, it does not directly answer the user's question about the command to check failed executions.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 3**",
        "judge_feedback_context_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe retrieved context is related to the IPVPN-SM application, which is used for monitoring and reporting network performance metrics. The provided context includes information about the application's architecture, configuration files, logging mechanisms, and troubleshooting steps.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the retrieved context does not directly address the query regarding the command to check failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM.\n\nThe provided context seems to be more focused on the overall architecture and functionality of the IPVPN-SM application, rather than providing specific information about checking failed executions in the Monitoring database.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the retrieved context, it appears that the context is not directly relevant to the query regarding checking failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM.\n\n### **Feedback:**\nThe score of 2 is given because the retrieved context is mostly irrelevant or off-topic. Although the context provides some general information about the IPVPN-SM application, it does not specifically address the query regarding checking failed executions in the Monitoring database.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 2\ufe0f\u20e3\nThis score indicates that the retrieved context is mostly irrelevant or off-topic, and therefore does not provide a satisfactory answer to the query.",

The provided SQL query seems relevant and well-structured.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the query is not entirely accurate. Specifically, the `select distinct` clause may not be necessary, and the `from` clause could be simplified.\n\nDespite these minor issues, the chatbot response demonstrates a good understanding of the problem domain and provides a relevant and mostly accurate solution.\n\n### **Score:** 4\n\nThe score of 4 reflects the chatbot's ability to provide a relevant and mostly accurate solution. While there are some minor issues with the provided SQL query, overall the chatbot demonstrates a good understanding of the problem domain.",
