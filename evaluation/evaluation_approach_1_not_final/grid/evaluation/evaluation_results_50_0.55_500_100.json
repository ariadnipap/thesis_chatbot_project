In this short guide, it explained how you can repair the replication on the MySQL slave. This guide is for MySQL.\n### Glossary\n- MYSQL replication: It is a process that enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to copied automatically to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)\n## Setup\n### Mysql Instances\n#### PR\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n## Procedure\n### Identify the problem\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n      ```\n2. If one of `Slave_IO_Running` or `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`, then the replication is broken\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n6. Start trcpe and check status\n```bash\ntrcpe-start\ntrcpe-status\n```\n7. Login to https://999.999.999.999:8743/rcpe/ with user and shared credentials. You must be able to see the newly created domain.\n### Move users to the created domain\n1. Back up mysql SSO_USERS table:\n```bash\nmysqldump -u root  -p test_r_cpe SSO_USERS --single-transaction > /tmp/SSO_USERS_BACKUP.sql\n```\n2. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\n```\n3. After succesfully restoration on **Slave Mysql Host** start slave:\n      ``` bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n      - No error should exist on `Last_Error`\n      - If no error appeared then `START SLAVE`\n      ```bash\n      START SLAVE;\n      ```\n\t  \n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n## Setup\n### Mysql Instances\n#### PR\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n# Manage IDM Replication\n[TOC]\n## Setup\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/configuration/ServiceWeaver/beanconfig/`\n**Application Logs**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/log/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/log/access_log.log`\n##### MySQL\nMySQL is the database used for the UI. Apart from other things, configuration data managed by users are stored there.\n**MySQL Servers**: `db01.bigdata.abc.gr` and `db02.bigdata.abc.gr` with vIP `999.999.999.999`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n#### DR\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `dr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `dr1node02.mno.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n4.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

Also, verify if there are any partitions containing less alarms than usual. This can indicate issues with the TeMIP server or the application.\n\n3. **Wait for terminated alarms to refresh**: If you need to reload historical data directly from the TeMIP Oracle Database into your terminated alarms table, wait for 7 days from the day you want to reload.

Removing `set num_nodes = 1` from the script `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`.\n4. Disabling HBase quotas for `PROD_IBANK` before re-running the script.\nThe script ran successfully after these changes.",

For example:\n```bash\nselect count(*) from (select distinct * from energy_efficiency.cell where par_dt='20211210') a;\n```\nThese queries can help you identify and troubleshoot duplicate records in the Energy Efficiency dataset.",

If queries are stalled, cancel them from `Cloudera > Impala > Queries`.\n3. Restart the Impala daemon on affected nodes.\n4. If the issue persists, analyze memory usage and consider redistributing workload across nodes.\nThese steps ensure that Impala recovers from heavy client loads and resumes processing efficiently.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To troubleshoot performance degradation in Impala caused by concurrent client connections, you can follow these steps:\n1. **Identify system or service errors**: Check the log files for any error messages related to Impala or its components.\n2. **Analyze Impala query performance**: Use tools like Impala Query UI or Impala Shell to analyze the performance of individual queries and identify potential bottlenecks.\n3. **Monitor concurrent client connections**: Use monitoring tools like Ganglia or Nagios to monitor the number of concurrent client connections to Impala and identify any patterns or trends that may be contributing to performance degradation.\n4. **Adjust Impala configuration settings**: Based on the analysis and monitoring results, adjust Impala configuration settings such as the number of query execution threads, the amount of memory allocated to each query, or the timeout settings for queries and connections.\n\nBy following these steps, you can troubleshoot performance degradation in Impala caused by concurrent client connections and identify potential solutions to improve performance.",

Also these metrics are stored into an Impala table.\n### CPU and Memory\n#### Main script\n## Input Performance Data\nThere are two source systems, HP Network Node Manager (NNM) and SNMP Custom Poller application, that poll periodically network elements and produces raw files with the instantenous metrics. These files are then parsed by one or more procedures. Finally they are loaded to BigStreamer cluster in Impala tables. There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files\n*Connect to Impala (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*  \n```\nselect * from (\n  select distinct  'activity' tbl, upd_ts from def_network_map.activity union all\n  select distinct  'affected_customers', upd_ts from def_network_map.affected_customers union all\n  select distinct  'affected_oct_wtt', upd_ts from def_network_map.affected_oct_wtt union all\n  select distinct  'defective_netw_element', upd_ts from def_network_map.defective_netw_element union all\n1.
