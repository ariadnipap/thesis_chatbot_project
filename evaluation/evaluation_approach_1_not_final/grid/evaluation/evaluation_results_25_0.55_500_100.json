From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n      ```\n2. If one of `Slave_IO_Running` or `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`, then the replication is broken\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n6. Start trcpe and check status\n```bash\ntrcpe-start\ntrcpe-status\n```\n7. Login to https://999.999.999.999:8743/rcpe/ with user and shared credentials. You must be able to see the newly created domain.\n### Move users to the created domain\n1. Back up mysql SSO_USERS table:\n```bash\nmysqldump -u root  -p test_r_cpe SSO_USERS --single-transaction > /tmp/SSO_USERS_BACKUP.sql\n```\n2. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\n```\n3. After succesfully restoration on **Slave Mysql Host** start slave:\n      ``` bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n      - No error should exist on `Last_Error`\n      - If no error appeared then `START SLAVE`\n      ```bash\n      START SLAVE;\n      ```\n\t  \n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n## Setup\n### Mysql Instances\n#### PR\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n# Manage IDM Replication\n[TOC]\n## Setup\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/configuration/ServiceWeaver/beanconfig/`\n**Application Logs**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/log/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/log/access_log.log`\n##### MySQL\nMySQL is the database used for the UI. Apart from other things, configuration data managed by users are stored there.\n**MySQL Servers**: `db01.bigdata.abc.gr` and `db02.bigdata.abc.gr` with vIP `999.999.999.999`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n#### DR\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `dr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `dr1node02.mno.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\t- Both Slave_IO_Running and Slave_SQL_Running are set to `Yes` now. And the replication is running without any error.\n\t- `Seconds_Behind_Master` should be 0 after some minutes",

In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n## Procedure\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\nname: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart.

So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\t1.

In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n---\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n1.

Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n<b>Description:</b>\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\nServer:\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\nUseful info:\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n### Prerequisites\n1.

Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n- [Home URL](https://999.999.999.999:8888/)\n- **User:** `admin`\n- **Password:** [abc-syspasswd.kdbx](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/abc-syspasswd.kdbx)\n#### Change logging level\n1.

However, upon closer examination, it appears that the steps are not directly relevant to creating a Dell support ticket for a hardware issue.\n\nFor instance, the initial steps involve using SSH to access an issue node, finding the Management IP, and installing the ipmitool package if necessary. These actions seem more aligned with advanced troubleshooting or server management tasks rather than the straightforward process of creating a support ticket.\n\nFurthermore, the subsequent steps that involve connecting to the IDRAC interface via VNC, opening Firefox to access the IDRAC web interface, navigating to specific sections to copy the Service Tag number, and then calling Dell support to provide them with this information, also seem overly complicated and not directly focused on the primary goal of creating a support ticket.\n\nIn contrast, the reference answer provides a clear, concise, and directly relevant set of steps for creating a Dell support ticket. This includes retrieving the service tag from iDRAC, exporting lifecycle logs, opening a case on Dell Support with the service tag, sending the exported TSR zip file to Dell, and following Dell\u2019s instructions for any necessary updates.\n\nGiven this analysis, it's clear that while the chatbot response attempts to provide helpful information, it falls short in terms of relevance, clarity, and direct applicability to the task at hand, which is creating a Dell support ticket for a hardware issue.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 2**\n\nThis score reflects the chatbot response's lack of direct relevance and clarity in addressing the user's question about how to create a Dell support ticket for a hardware issue.

        "chatbot_answer": " ```\n### Answer\nTo remove duplicate records before running an ingestion job, you can use the `report_duplicates_kudu_hbase_impala_STABLE.sh` script. This script deletes data that exists in both Impala and Kudu/HBase.\n\nBefore running this script, make sure to check the logs for any errors. You can also safely skip this step if not running for the previous day.\n\nHere is a sample execution of the script:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/report_duplicates_kudu_hbase_impala_STABLE.sh `date --date='-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'` prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream prod_trlog_online.service_audit_old online >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/report_duplicates_kudu_hbase_impala.log 2>&1\n``` ```\nThis script will delete any duplicate records that exist in both Impala and Kudu/HBase. By running this script before running an ingestion job, you can ensure that there are no duplicate records in your data. ``` ```\n### Hourly Merge Batch\nimpala-shell -k --ssl -i ${HOSTNAME/01/} -q \"select  count(*) from prod_trlog_ibank.historical_service_audit_v1 where par_dt like '20191109';\"\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\nA[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old] -->|Impala Insert| B[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit]\n```\n### Distinct join to Service Audit\nSome records that are ingested by the [Stream](#stream) can also be present in the MSSQL server.
