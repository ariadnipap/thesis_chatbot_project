The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n1. Main Application flow\n1.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

This additional information could help in identifying the root cause of the issue and finding a suitable solution. \n\nPlease let me know if I can assist further! \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` ```",

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/hbase2\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload\ndisable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell",

On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=0                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:04:51.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | FAILED  | com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.AppEmptyQueryException | 2023-05-10 07:05:02.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=1                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:05:22.000 |\n#### Inspect specific metric request\nIn case of alerts, we should first check the status of the particular requests on the monitoring DB.\nUsing the metric category and the reference interval associated with a request to IPVPN-SM App we can query the Monitoring DB\nby passing the corresponding job and operative_partition values.\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`",
