Scheduling\nInformation on the Oozie coordinator, workflow, execution schedule, and trigger script.\n- user : `brond`\n- Coordinator :`Brond_Load_Retrains_Coord_NEW`  \n\truns at : `04:10, 05:10, 06:10, 10:10 UTC`\n- Workflow : `Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW`  \n- Main script : `HDFS:/user/brond/000.Brond_Retrains_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- SSH Identity file : `HDFS:/user/brond/id_rsa`\nNdef: **Main Script** runs `oozie_brond_retrains.sh` located on `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr` using **ssh** as user **brond**  \n`$ ssh -o \"StrictHostKeyChecking no\" -i ./id_rsa brond@un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr \"/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/oozie_brond_retrains.sh\"`\n### Hive Tables\nThe target Hive table used for storing parsed retrains data.\n- Target Database: `brond`\n- Target Tables: `brond.brond_retrains_hist`\n### Beeline-Impala Shell commands\nCommands for querying and managing data using Hive (Beeline) and Impala.\n- Beeline: `/usr/bin/beeline -u \"jdbc:hive2://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:10000/default;principal=hive/_HOST@CNE.abc.GR;ssl=true;sslTrustStore=/usr/java/latest/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts;trustStorePassword=changeit\"`\n- Impala-shell: `/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k`\n## Data process: How raw FTP files get into Hive\nStep-by-step process of how retrains data files move from the FTP server to the final Hive table, including renaming, parsing, HDFS upload, and Hive loading.\n1. sftp get raw files (*.csv.gz) from FTP Server to `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n```bash\necho \"ls -l ADSL_Brond\" | sftp bigd@999.999.999.999\n\nsftp> ls -l ADSL_Brond\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 21902115 Nov 28 07:02 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.328_2022_11_28.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 21925249 Nov 29 06:22 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.329_2022_11_29.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 22107252 Nov 30 06:52 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz\n```\n2. rename the raw file(s) in remdef SFTP server by adding the suffix .LOADED\n`echo \"rename /ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz /ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz.LOADED\" | sftp -oport=22 bigd@999.999.999.999`\n3. unzip raw files using `gzip -d` command in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n4. parsing raw files in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n- removes the headers (1st line)\n- removes double-qudefs chars\n- defines the PAR_DT value from the filename (i.e. Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz convert to 20221130)\n- add the prefix `RETR___` to raw file\n- add the suffix `<load time>.parsed` to raw file  \nLoad time format:`<YYYYMMDD_HHMISS>`  \ni.e. `RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed`\n5. put raw files into HDFS landingzone\n`hdfs dfs -put /data/1/brond_retr_LZ/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed /ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed`\n6. clean-up any copy of the raw files from local filesystem  \n`/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`  \n`/shared/brond_retr_repo`  \n7. load HDFS files into hive table `brond.brond_retrains_hist`\n`beeline -e \"LOAD DATA INPATH '/ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE brond.brond_retrains_hist PARTITION (par_dt='20221130')\"`\n8. execute compute stats using impala-shell  \n```bash\n/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k\t\ncompute incremental stats brond.brond_retrains_hist;\n```\nIn the event where multiple files are transfered (files refer to the same data), we proceed with overwriting data in brond table. Deletion of those multiple files is abc's responsibility.\n## Monitoring\nHow the pipeline’s execution is tracked using monitoring logs and component-level messages.\n### Monitoring connection

Go to \"Jobs\" > \"Workflows\"\nIf all workflow executions (\"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\") were successful, you can proceed by checking that the file(s)\nabc added, were copied after the scheduled timings of the workflow\n### Check added files\nsftp get raw files (*.csv.gz) from FTP Server to `/data/1/brond_dsl_stats_LZ`\n```\necho \"ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\" | sftp bigd@999.999.999.999\nsftp> ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150589497 Nov 29 05:34 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.329_2022_11_29.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150823890 Nov 29 13:21 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.330_2022_11_29.csv.gz\n```\nThe second file was indeed added after the scheduled time and has not been picked up by the workflow.\n### Trigger workflow\nYou can now proceed to manually trigger the workflow:\n1. Go to HUE and select \"Jobs\"\n2. Go to \"Workflow\" and select \"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\"\n3. In the next screen, select \"Rerun\"\n4. Wait for the workflow to successfully end\n5.

        "chatbot_response": " The Brond Retrains pipeline handles raw file ingestion and Hive loading through a series of steps. First, it retrieves raw files from an FTP server using SFTP. These files are then processed, which includes unzipping, parsing, and adding prefixes and suffixes as needed. After processing, the files are loaded into HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) landing zones. From there, they are further loaded into Hive tables, specifically into the `brond.brond_retrains_hist` table. This process ensures that the raw data is properly ingested, processed, and made available for analysis in Hive. \n```",

remdef SFTP server by adding the suffix .LOADED\n`echo \"rename /ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz /ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz.LOADED\" | sftp -oport=22 bigd@999.999.999.999`\n3. unzip raw files using `gzip -d` command in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n4. parsing raw files in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n- removes the headers (1st line)\n- removes double-qudefs chars\n- defines the PAR_DT value from the filename (i.e. Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz convert to 20221130)\n- add the prefix `RETR___` to raw file\n- add the suffix `<load time>.parsed` to raw file  \nLoad time format:`<YYYYMMDD_HHMISS>`  \ni.e. `RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed`\n5. put raw files into HDFS landingzone\n`hdfs dfs -put /data/1/brond_retr_LZ/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed

\n`/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`  \n`/shared/brond_retr_repo`  \n7. load HDFS files into hive table `brond.brond_retrains_hist`\n`beeline -e \"LOAD DATA INPATH '/ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE brond.brond_retrains_hist PARTITION

This can only be done by manually triggering the workflow. Before doing so, you need to make some checks first:\n### Check workflow logs\n1. Login to https://999.999.999.999:8888/hue/accounts/login?next=/hue using the brond account\n2. Go to \"Jobs\" > \"Workflows\"\nIf all workflow executions (\"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\") were successful, you can proceed by checking that the file(s)\nabc added, were copied after the scheduled timings of the workflow\n### Check added files\nsftp get raw files (*.csv.gz) from FTP Server to `/data/1/brond_dsl_stats_LZ`\n```\necho \"ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\" | sftp bigd@999.999.999.999\nsftp> ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150589497 Nov 29 05:34 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.329_2022_11_29.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150823890 Nov 29 13:21 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.330_2022_11_29.csv.gz\n```\nThe second file was indeed added after the scheduled time and has not been picked up by the workflow.\n### Trigger workflow\nYou can now proceed to manually trigger the workflow:\n1. Go to HUE and select \"Jobs\"\n2. Go to \"Workflow\" and select \"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\"\n3. In the next screen, select \"Rerun\"\n4. Wait for the workflow to successfully end\n5.

The **Export** procedure is implemented by def/abc.  \n\tIt is responsible to prepare the data in Oracle tables (see Oracle Table list in [Data Source Tables](#data-source-tables))  \n\tOnce completed, it updates the `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` column with the current system's timestamp.   \n\tNdef: It is not known how often the **Export** procedure runs.\n2.  The **Import** procedure is implemented by jkl.  \n\tIt checks periodically if the value of `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` has been updated.  \n\t- In case of new value, the procedure exports the data from the Oracle tables  \n\t`./oracle_cmd.sh \"select * from <table>\" > ./<table>.exp`  \n\t- stores them into HDFS  \n\t`hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal ./<table>.exp .`\n\t- and, consequently, load them into the corresponding [Hive Tables](#hive-tables).  \n\t*Connect to Beeline (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`Beeline <connection> -e \"load data inpath './<table>.exp' overwrite into table <table>;\"`\n\t- Once the Import procedure completed, the `IMPORT_START_DT` column will be updated with the current system's timestamp.   \n\t*Connect to Oracle (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`update def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT`\n\t- Compute table statistics using impala-shell\t \n\t*Connect to Impala (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`compute incremental stats brond.brond_retrains_hist;`\n3.

Check the monitoring.jobstatus table for messages related to the def_NETWORK_MAP flow. You can use a query like the one provided in the context to filter the results.\n2. Look for messages with a status of \"SUCCESS\" and a component that matches the step you are interested in (e.g., \"EXPORT_DATA-<TABLE-NAME>\" or \"LOAD_DATA-<TABLE-NAME>\").\n3. Verify that the number of rows exported from Oracle and loaded into Hive matches the expected count.\n4. Check the logs for any errors or warnings related to the data transfer process.\n5. Use Impala or Beeline to query the Hive tables and verify that the data has been successfully transferred.\n\nBy following these steps, you can verify successful Oracle to Hive data transfers in the def_NETWORK_MAP flow.",

from Oracle and ingested into Hive tables.\n### In General\nThe flow consist of two basic procedures and one control Oracle table.  \n\t- the **Export** procedure, which is running at the remdef Oracle server (Responsible def/abc),  \n\t- the **Import** procedure, which is running at the BigStreamer cluster,  \n\t- the `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL` table, used to synchronize the **Export** procedure with the **Import** procedure.  \nThe data in `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL` is similar to the following\nConnect to Oracle (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))  \n```\nselect

The **Export** procedure is implemented by def/abc.  \n\tIt is responsible to prepare the data in Oracle tables (see Oracle Table list in [Data Source Tables](#data-source-tables))  \n\tOnce completed, it updates the `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` column with the current system's timestamp.   \n\tNdef: It is not known how often the **Export** procedure runs.\n2.  The **Import** procedure is implemented by jkl.  \n\tIt checks periodically if the value of `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` has been updated.  \n\t- In case of new value, the procedure exports the data from the Oracle tables  \n\t`./oracle_cmd.sh \"select * from <table>\" > ./<table>.exp`  \n\t- stores them into HDFS  \n\t`hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal ./<table>.exp .`\n\t- and, consequently, load them into the corresponding [Hive Tables](#hive-tables).  \n\t*Connect to Beeline (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`Beeline <connection> -e \"load data inpath './<table>.exp' overwrite into table <table>;\"`\n\t- Once the Import procedure completed, the `IMPORT_START_DT` column will be updated with the current system's timestamp.   \n\t*Connect to Oracle (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`update def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT`\n\t- Compute table statistics using impala-shell\t \n\t*Connect to Impala (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`compute incremental stats brond.brond_retrains_hist;`\n3. In case the `EXPORT_START_DT` value isn't updated, the **Import** procedure exists doing nothing.\n## Monitoring\nDescribes how load jobs are tracked in the monitoring.jobstatus table and validated via logs and queries.\n### Monitoring connection details\n|Field|Value|\n|-|-|\n|Database Type| mysql  \n|Host| 999.999.999.999  \n|DB Name| monitoring  \n|DB User| monitoring  \n|Table| jobstatus  \nConnection command: `/usr/bin/mysql -u monitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999 monitoring`\n### Monitoring Message list → Monitoring Messages in MySQL\nFor each load for each TABLE the following set of messages will be recorded in the Monitoring database.\n```sql\nexecution_id | id     | application | job             | component                 | operative_partition | status  | system_ts           | system_ts_end       | param0 | message                                                              | user             | host                    \n-------------+--------+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+---------------------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------------\n1670509202   | 402171 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | MAIN                      | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:02 | 2022-12-08 16:22:05 |        | Procedure Started                                                    | def_network_maps | un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr\n1670509202   | 402173 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | CHECK_FOR_AVAILABLE_DATA  | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:02 |                     |        | New data found: 2022-12-08 15:50:04                                  | def_network_maps | un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr\n1670509202   | 402207 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | EXPORT_DATA-<TABLE-NAME>  | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:24 |                     | 6987   | Oracle export def_NETWORK_MAP.OPEN_NTT data.

Check the monitoring app for successful executions: Use the provided `curl` command to query the monitoring API for successful job executions.\n\n2. Check the application logs in Hue: Log in to Hue as the `dwhfixed` user and navigate to the Jobs -> Workflows section to view the workflow execution logs.\n\n3. Validate data in Hive/Impala tables: Use Beeline or Impala-shell to connect to the Hive/Impala cluster and execute queries to validate the data loaded into the target tables.\n\n4. Check for any errors or warnings in the logs: Review the application logs and monitoring API responses for any error messages or warnings that may indicate issues with the data loading process.\n\nBy following these steps, you can manually validate the latest data loaded by the DWHFixed ETL pipeline and ensure that the data is accurate and complete. \n```bash\n-Dhadoop.security.credential.provider.path=${jsec_file} \\\n--password-alias dm_sas_va.pass \\\n--connect jdbc:oracle:thin:@999.999.999.999:6644/DWHPRD \\\n--username dm_sas_va \\\n--query \"select * FROM SAS_VA_VIEW.V_DW_CONTROL_TABLE where 1=1\" ;\n```\nAlternative way of checking Oracle:\n```bash\nssh <username>@undt1\nsu -l intra\nexport ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\nexport PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:${PATH}\nexport SQLPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:${SQLPATH}\nexport NLS_DATE_FORMAT='yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss'\nexport HISTSIZE=0\nsqlplus dm_sas_va/<Oracle-pass>@999.999.999.999:6644/DWHPRD\n```\n### Hive/Impala failure\n- Beeline load data inpath has failed.\n- Impala refresh has failed.\nHow to check Hive/Impala:\n- In the Hue UI mentioned above, click on editor -> Hive/Impala\n- Run the following query on each:`select * from dwhfixed.v_sria_subarea_dim_hist limit 3;`\n### Actions\n//TODO\n```sql\n-- Query to validate data in target tables\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) AS row_count,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN column_name IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS null_count\nFROM \n    dwhfixed.v_sria_subarea_dim_hist;\n```\n# abc - IM1421557 - CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt file with no data \n## Description\nThis issue occurred due to missing records in a dependent partition of the brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist table used in the CSI fix pipeline.

The result was an empty export for CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt.\nYesterday's file was zero.\n-1 172.25.37.240 CSI_FIXED CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt 0 1/21/2021 11:00:10 AM 35 1/21/2021 11:00:10 AM CSI_FIXED:CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt:20210121110010035918\n## Actions Taken\n1. Execute steps 1-5 from [this doc](knowledge-base/abc/BigStreamer/20201125-IM1363226.md)\n2. After the check we saw that table `brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist` had no data for 20210119 and 20210120, even though upstream tables were populated.\n```bash\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20210115'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\nResult:\ncount(*)\tpar_dt\t\n...\n2491814\t20210117\t\n2491872\t20210118\t\n2494261\t20210121\t\n...\n```\n3. Check coordinator `coord_brond_load_dsl_daily_stats` that populates this table as explained in [here](systems-info/abc/BigStreamer/Brond/cube_indicators_pipeline.md). \n4. Check that source tables `brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week` and `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week` have data for these partitions. Same query for `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week`\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week\nwhere par_dt >= '20210115'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\nResult:\ncount(*)\tpar_dt\t\n...\n1806006\t20210116\t\n1806256\t20210117\t\n1806306\t20210118\t\n1808049\t20210119\t\n1808918\t20210120\t\n1810234\t20210121\t\n1811401\t20210122\t\n```\nAs source tables have data, we have to execute only the missing inserts for the affected partitions.\n> Since both ADSL and VDSL source tables contained data for `20210119` and `20210120`, the issue is isolated to the execution of the DSL stats coordinator.\n5. Impala insert queries are under `/user/intra/brond_dsl_stats/impala-shell/populate*.sql`. Change conditions `..par_dt > '20210127..` to get the dates that are missing. In this case `20210119`. Execute the queries using Hue or impala-shell.\n6. Repeat step 2 to validate that data are loaded correctly for missing dates.\n7.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\nStep-by-step description of how the ETL pipeline is executed using scripts and Spring Boot app.\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### IPVPN-SM Endpoint: /ingest-query\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n### Check application status\n```bash\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n## Application Flow Diagram\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n# Failure Handling\nHow to debug failed requests, interpret logs, and what to check first when something breaks.\n## Logs\n### Failure Log Locations\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\nWhere to check system health (Grafana, MySQL), common exceptions and their causes, and support scripts.\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Visual Dashboards (Grafana)\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DataBase (MySQL)\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```sql\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException (Impala Query Returned No Data)\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException (SQM Ingestion Failure)\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException (Schema Mismatch)\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException (Transformation Failure)\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMAuthException (Token Auth Failure)\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n### Manual Retry: sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh {#manual-call}\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\n1.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\nStep-by-step description of how the ETL pipeline is executed using scripts and Spring Boot app.\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### IPVPN-SM Endpoint: /ingest-query\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n### Check application status\n```bash\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n## Application Flow Diagram\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n# Failure Handling\nHow to debug failed requests, interpret logs, and what to check first when something breaks.\n## Logs\n### Failure Log Locations\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\nWhere to check system health (Grafana, MySQL), common exceptions and their causes, and support scripts.\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Visual Dashboards (Grafana)\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DataBase (MySQL)\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```sql\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

Switch to root and find the iDRAC management IP:\n```bash\nsudo -i\nipmitool lan print | grep -i 'IP Address'\n# If ipmitool is missing:\nyum install ipmitool\n```\n3. Open Firefox on a VNC session and navigate to the iDRAC IP address found in Step 2.\n4. From `Server-->Overview-->Server Information` copy the `Service Tag number`\n5. Call Dell support `2108129800`. They need the `Service Tag number` from step 4\n6. A DELL engineer will create a case and send you all the necessary instructions. If not the link to collect the TSR logs is `https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/el-gr/000126803/export-a-supportassist-collection-via-idrac7-and-idrac8`\n7. Inform `abc` before any action on the IDRAC.\n8. Download the TSR `.zip` file locally from the iDRAC interface. If using VNC on a node like `un4`, the downloaded files will be stored under: `/home/cloudera/Downloads/`. The filename format is: `TSR<date>_<service_tag>.zip`.\n9. Send the zip file/files to DELL and wait for their response.\n## Completion\nYou have now completed the process. Await DELL’s response and proceed based on their instructions.\n---\ntitle: mn3 Node Lost Contact with Cloudera Manager Due to CPU Machine Check Error\ndescription: The mn3 node lost connectivity with Cloudera Manager due to CPU hardware errors (\"Machine check error detected\") which required a manual cold reboot via iDRAC.

This host is not in contact with the Host Monitor.\n## Actions Taken\n1. From `admin` tried to reach mn3 but with no response:\nAttempt to verify connectivity from admin to mn3 node.\n```bash\nping mn3\n```\n2. Since there is no response from `mn3` time to reboot server.\nLogin to `admin` from ad hoc connection and then type from command line `firefox`.\nSelect `default profile` and go to idrac for mn3 `https://10.255.242.85/` with the credentials you can find [here](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx).\n3. From left Column click on `Server` and then go to `Logs`.\nAt that moment we see the following error for CPU:\n```bash\nMon Mar 13 2023 08:44:27 CPU 1 machine check error detected.\nMon Mar 13 2023 08:44:27 CPU 2 machine check error detected.\nMon Mar 13 2023 08:44:27 CPU 1 machine check error detected.\n```\n4. Time to reboot server:\nFrom `https://10.255.242.85/` go to Server and then click on `Power Cycle System (cold boot)`\n5. In order to check that server is up and running open java console, otherwise check logs from left Column click on `Server` and then go to `Logs`\n6. Login to Cloudera Manager with your personal account and then to `Hosts` -> `All hosts` and search for mn3.\nVerify that it is back again to cluster.\n7. Login to `admin` and then ssh to `mn3` in order to verify that cloudera agent is up and running.\n```bash\nsystemctl status cloudera-scm-agent status\n```\n## Investigation\n1.

At the same path there is the script `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` that loads the reference data from the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table to the `refdata.rd_cells` table, so that the two tables have the latest data recorded. These actions are handled by different server coordinators of cloudera manager. \nWe checked the log files for each month at the `/shared/abc/refdata/log` path to see which coordinator was responsible for these processes at September 12. After that we logged in Cloudera Manager, and checked the log files at the specific time interval. We found that due to synchronization issues , the coordinator that updated `refdata.rd_cells` updated it before the procedure that refreshed the data at  `refdata.rd_cells_load` so it read the data from the previous date.\nThe solution was to add the parameter **set SYNC_DDL=1** at the necessary scripts so there are no synchronization issues.\nThe logs at cloudera manager are deleted after a certain period of time, so they need to be checked soon after the ticket.\n---\ntitle: Reference Data ETL Flow\nsystem: BigStreamer\ncomponent: Reference Data\njob_name: refdata_etl\nsource_system: Local Filesystem (vantagerd)\nsource_tables:\n  - cells_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz\n  - crm_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz\n  - devices_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz\n  - services_YYYYMMDD.csv.gz\ndestination_system: Hive\ndestination_tables:\n  - refdata.rd_cells_load\n  - refdata.rd_services_load\n  - refdata.rd_crm_load\n  - refdata.rf_devices_load\nschedule: daily at 00:05\ncoordinator: none (cron-based)\nworkflow: 210_refData_Load.sh / 220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh\nscript_path: /shared/abc/refdata/bin\nmonitoring_table: none\nowner: intra\ntags:\n  - Reference Data\n  - refdata\n  - rd_cells_load\n  - rd_crm_load\n  - rd_services_load\n  - rf_devices_load\n  - Hive\n  - Snapshot\n  - Crontab\n  - Bash Scripts\n  - Troubleshooting\n  - Data Validation\n  - Vantagerd\n---\n# Reference Data Flow\nThis document describes the reference data ingestion process for cells, CRM, devices, and services.

Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n## Pollaploi Flow\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n## Troubleshooting Steps\nGuidance for identifying if a file has been successfully picked up, processed, and loaded.\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day.

During the previous execution, an `UPSERT` that should have marked the job status as `SUCCESS` failed because the Hive Metastore was unavailable (see SD2046350). As a result, the job status remained `RUNNING`, preventing subsequent executions.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account and then `sudo su - PRODUSER`\n2. We tried to re-run the script using the following command:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t timeDeposit\n```\nBut we got the following error:\n**ERROR DESCRIPTION=ANOTHER_PROCESS_RUNNING**\n3. After investigation at impala queries and alert notification we realized that at `10/04/2022 8:29 AM` which was the time that the `extract` of `time_deposit` was running, the upsert that updates the status (SUCCEDED/RUNINNG/FAILED) of the job, failed due to hive metastore unavailability at that time. \n> Ndef: Hive metastore issue is discribed at **SD2046350**\n## Root Cause Analysis\nWe found that with below steps:\n- From DR CM UI -> Impala -> Queries \n- In searh bar type: `statement rlike 'upsert into prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.*'` and click on `Search` to find the query\nLogin to dr1edge01 with your personal account and then `sudo su - PRODUSER`\nInvestigate impala tables with below commands:\n```bash\nimpala-shell -k -i dr1edge01.mno.gr --ssl\nSHOW CREATE TABLE prod_trlog_bank_analytical.dwh_monitoring;\nSELECT * FROM prod_trlog_bank_analytical.dwh_monitoring WHERE details_type='TIME_DEPOSIT' and\n'procedure'='EXTRACT' and par_dt > 20221002;\n```\nTherefore, at `10/05/2022` when the script executed again, the job crashed due to the fact that the value on the impala table was set to RUNNING. \nWe had to manually change he value of yesterday's job to `SUCCESS` using the following impala query.\nFirst, login to dr1edge01 with your presonal account, change to PRODUSER with `sudo su - PRODUSER` and login to impala-shell using following command:\n```bash\nimpala-shell -k -i dr1edge01.mno.gr --ssl\n```\nIn our case we run the following query:\n```bash\nUPSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_monitoring\n(details_type, procedure_par_dt,status.start_time,end_time,description) VALUES\n('TIME DEPOSIT','EXTRACT','20221003','SUCCESS','2022-10-04','08:32-42.000','2022-10-04','08-39:21.000',\")\n```\n> Ndef: In case you want to run the above query for a different job modify VALUES according the procedure_par_dt, details_type, etc\n4.

More specifically:\nAfter the **put command at step 3** of the mentioned guide, continue with the following steps below(8-10).\n8. Refreshed table on impala with `refresh aums.archive_metadata` and checked if new partitions were created (impaala queries at step 6). No new partitions had been created.\n9. From Streamsets UI, stop and then start  `AUMS Metadata File Feed` pipeline. If stopping takes too long you can **Force Stop** the pipeline.\n10. Then refresh impala again and ran queries about the days that the data was missing. The queries verified that data had loaded.\n11.

Login to `admin.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to root with sudo\n2. Inspect the status of sshd on all nodes\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'grep \"^PermitRootLogin\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config'\n```\n3. Inspect cronjobs of root user on all nodes\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'cronjob -l'\n```\n4. After collecting the scripts executed by root user, we checked the scripts that contain the words `ssh`, `scp` and `rsync`\n```bash\nfor i in {'/root/disk_balance_with_check.sh' '/usr/local/bin/CM_Config_Backup.sh' '/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch_monitoring.sh' '/etc/keepalived/scripts/mysql_check_crontab.sh' '/home/intra/scripts/MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh' '/usr/local/bin/krb5prop.sh' '/root/scripts/ldap_check.sh' '/root/send_haproxy_statistics.sh' '/root/send_haproxy_weekly_statistics.sh' '/home/intra/MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh' '/home/intra/dfs-backup.sh' '/usr/lib/icom/scripts/cdsw_rsync_backup.sh' '/usr/lib/icom/scripts/cdsw_tar_backup.sh' '/home/intra/MySQL_Dump_spec_DB.sh' '/home/intra/scripts/hue_workflows_all.sh' '/root/hive_logs_retention.sh'}\ndo\nsalt \"*\" cmd.run \"if [ -f $i ]; then grep -e ssh -e scp -e rsync $i; fi\" | grep -B1 -e ssh -e scp -e rsync\ndone\n```\n5. Configure ACLs for backup_user. User `backup_user` was created by abc admins to substitute the root login in the scripts above. From the above investigation we determined that `backup_user` needs to be able to login to nodes `un1.bigdata.abc.gr` and `wrkmncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr`\n```bash\n  # un1.bigdata.abc.gr\n  setfacl -R -m d:u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/cmdeploys/\n  setfacl -R -m u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/cmdeploys/\n  setfacl -R -m d:u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/db-backups/db-vip\n  setfacl -R -m u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/db-backups/db-vip\n  setfacl -R -m u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/dfs_backup/\n  setfacl -R -m d:u:backup_user:rwx /data/1/cm_backup/dfs_backup/\n  # Add backup_user to AllowedGroups in /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\n```bash\n  # wrkmncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr\n  setfacl -R -m u:backup_user:rwx /backup\n  setfacl -R -m d:u:backup_user:rwx /backup\n  # Add backup_user to AllowedGroups in /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\n6. Setup SSH Access and Keys. Created `backup user` saltstack state that installs a new private key for passwordless ssh under `/root/backup_user_id/id_backup_user_rsa` on all nodes\n7. Update Cron and Backup Scripts. Change the following scripts to use `backup_user` instead of `root`:\n- /usr/local/bin/CM_Config_Backup.sh\n- /home/intra/scripts/MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh\n- /home/intra/MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh\n- /home/intra/dfs-backup.sh\n- /usr/lib/icom/scripts/cdsw_rsync_backup.sh\n```conf\n# This script uses rsync.

Enforce SSH Policy with SaltStack. Change `PermitRootLogin` on all hosts.

Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n### Check signed certificates from mno\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer, subject, TLS Web, date.\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n- Check the issuer\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n- Check the subject\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this:\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n- Check the TLS Web\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n- Check the dates\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n- Or with a for loop for all the files\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder: `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ---\n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\nwith the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nwith the certificate from \n`cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \nand copy the section:\n```\n    ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n    .....\n\n    ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\nand replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`.\nFor example:\n```bash\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has sent to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same. If not, the certificate is wrong\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\nExplains how to safely stop Spark flows and prepare systems for certificate changes.\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n```\n# Signal Spark flows to shut down safely before cert replacement\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep -i PROD_\n```\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep DEVREST\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\nCovers how to copy, import, and activate the new signed certificates across all cluster nodes.\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\nFrom node01:\n#### Node certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n#### JKS certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n```\n# Import signed certificate into Cloudera's Java Keystore (JKS) on internal nodes\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n```",

It covers kubectl and helm installation, service account creation, role bindings, secrets, and kubeconfig generation—manually or using a plugin.\n## Tools\nThe main tool that needs to be installed is **kubectl**, instructions for which can be found\n[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).\n### Install bash completion for kubectl:\nAdditionally after\ninstallation, completion can be enabled by executing:\n```bash\nmkdir -p /etc/bash_completion.d\nkubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl\n```\nIf possible a nice to have plugin for setting up kubeconfigs can be found at\n[kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin](https://github.com/superbrothers/kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin/releases). Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the [instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing the following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\n### Apply service account and role binding\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\n### Generate user kubeconfig using plugin:\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n---\ntitle: Kubernetes Certificate Renewal Procedure\ndescription: Yearly renewal process for expiring Kubernetes certificates on kubemaster1, kubemaster2, and kubemaster3 including backup, kubeadm certs renewal, and container restarts.\ntags: [kubernetes, certificates, renewal, kubeadm, kubemaster, static pods, downtime, cluster-admin, tls]\ncategory: infrastructure\nproduct: BigStreamer\nplatform: kubernetes\nconfidentiality: internal\n---\n# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring.

Log events showed repeated errors related to mounting the `logs` volume, with specific references to device formatting failures (e.g., `mke2fs exit status 1`) and timeouts in the Kubernetes event log.\nDespite restarting the pod, it remained in an `Init:0/1` state. Investigations using `kubectl`, Longhorn UI, and `kubemaster` logs revealed that three PVC replicas were stuck in a deleting state, which blocked the volume from attaching correctly. This indicated a storage issue potentially linked to a bug in the Longhorn engine.\nThe airflow scheduler is down due to access rights in the logs folder.\npod airflow-scheduler-0 had entered a restart loop as shown below.\n```bash\nroot@kubemaster1:~# kubectl get pods -n ranai-geo\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nairflow-postgresql-0 1/1 Running 0 326d\nairflow-scheduler-0 0/2

investigate possible underlying storage issues, we accessed [Longhorn](https://kubemaster-vip.bigdata.abc.gr/longhorn/) and discovered that the PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) associated with the airflow-scheduler had three replicas of airflow-scheduler pvc stuck in a deleting state.\n![longhornUI](.media/longhornbug.JPG)\n## Resolution\nTo resolve the issue and restore the airflow-scheduler pod's functionality, the following steps were taken:\n### Deletion of Problematic PVC\nThe three problematic replicas of airflow-scheduler PVC in Longhorn, which were stuck in a deleting state, were the problem, as a result we deleted the airflow's PVC.\nNfgh: It is important to mention that this issue might be related to a bug within the Longhorn storage system, as it caused replicated PVCs to get stuck in a deleting state. Further investigation and monitoring of Longhorn may be necessary to prevent such issues from recurring. Also see this [thread](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4278)\n## Actions Taken\nDeleted problematic PVCs in Longhorn under instance-manager-r namespace.\n`kubectl delete pvc pvc-c826d577-e764-470e-9904-3986042810aa -n ranai-geo`\n## Recommendations\nMonitor Longhorn for any recurring issues with PVC management to prevent similar incidents.\n---\ntitle: Disable Root SSH Login and Migrate Backup Scripts to Non-Root User\ndescription: Step-by-step security hardening guide for BigStreamer environments to disable root SSH login, migrate backup and sync scripts to a dedicated backup user, configure SSH permissions via SaltStack, and assess existing SSH port forwarding usage across all nodes.\ntags:\n  - ssh\n  - saltstack\n  - sysadmin\n  - sshd_config\n  - root-login\n  - security-hardening\n  - acls\n  - backup-user\n  - port-forwarding\n  - bigstreamer\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  hosts:\n    - admin.bigdata.abc.gr\n    - un1.bigdata.abc.gr\n    - wrkmncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr\n  user:\n    root: disallowed\n    backup_user: created\n  files_updated:\n    - /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n    - various cron-based backup scripts\n  tools:\n    - saltstack\n    - rsync\n    - sshd\n  scripts_migrated:\n    - CM_Config_Backup.sh\n    - MySQL_Dump_All_DBs.sh\n    - dfs-backup.sh\n    - cdsw_rsync_backup.sh\n    - MySQL_Dump_spec_DB.sh\n---\n# Disabling Root SSH Login on BigStreamer Nodes - GI7 Ticket - abc Security Requirement Implementation\n## Description\nSecurity requirements from abc mandates that we should change the ssh configuration in all servers in order not to permit root ssh login\n## Actions Taken\n1.

The crash was caused by an `OutOfMemoryError`, due to the default Java heap size being set too low (512MB).\nThe following health issue has occurred in the cloudera manager system:\n```\nSpark on yarn - History Server (dr1node03) - Unexpected Exits\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for DR Site\n2. We inspected logs for this role for the time that the problem arose: `Cloudera > Diagnostics > Logs` and chose `Service: Spark on Yarn` and `Role: History Server`. We could not identify the root cause by these logs\n3. ssh to dr1node03 as root, went to `/var/run/process` , and inspected logs from the process that ran at the time of the problem and found out that the process with pid 51291 was killed while a `OutOfMemoryError` occured\n![terminal_screenshot](.media/IM2098517/spark_on_yarn.png)\n### Resolution\n4. We checked the  `java heap size` of the History Server through Cloudera UI configuration tab. It was set to 512M.\n5. We checked the respective option for the PR Site and it was set to 2G\n6. We set the `java heap size` of the History Server to 2G at the DR Site\n7. We proceeded to restart of the role after communication with the customer\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n07/03/23 16:28:55 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nWe have restarted the History Server after a phone call. There was no problem during the restart.\nThank you\n07/03/23 16:21:21 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe exit occurred due to an out of memory error. We have changed the java heap size of the History Server from 512MB to 2GB as in the PR. We will need to restart the role. There will be no outage.\n```\n---\ntitle: Oracle Java 1.8 Minor Upgrade on Edge Nodes\ndescription: Procedure for upgrading Oracle Java 1.8 to a newer minor version on BigStreamer edge nodes, including local RPM repository setup, edge node preparation, execution, certificate handling, update-alternatives configuration, and rollback instructions.\ntags:\n  - java\n  - oracle-java\n  - upgrade\n  - edge-nodes\n  - yum\n  - rpm\n  - certificates\n  - update-alternatives\n  - rollback\n  - cloudera\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  systems:\n    - pr1edge01\n    - pr1edge02\n    - dr1edge01\n    - dr1edge02\n    - pr1node01\n  tools:\n    - Oracle Java 8\n    - YUM\n    - update-alternatives\n    - Wildfly\n    - jssecacerts\n  repositories:\n    - /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n---\n# Oracle Java 1.8 Upgrade Procedure on Edge Nodes\nThis document describes the controlled upgrade of Oracle Java 1.8 minor versions on BigStreamer edge nodes. It covers the creation and maintenance of a local RPM repository on pr1node01, edge node backup and update procedures, handling of security certificates, switching Java versions using update-alternatives, and guidance for validating application behavior post-upgrade. Rollback steps are also provided.\nThis document outlines the upgrade process of minor java version for Oracle Java 1.8\non mno's edge nodes. All procedures pertain to PR and DR edge nodes, except the RPM repository\ncreation which is performed on pr1node1:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n## Step 1: Create Local RPM Repository\nThis step only needs to be performed once as all subsequent RPM's will be placed inside this\nrepository. SSH into **p1node01** and as root create the repository directories:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# mkdir -p /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n```\nDownload the desired RPMs from [Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html), place them inside\n`/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` and create the repository:\n```bash\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo .\n```\nSSH into one of the edge nodes, create the corresponding yum repo file and **scp** it into\nall other edge nodes:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxx@pr1edge01\n$ sudo -i\n# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo\n[oracle_java]\nname = oracle_java\nbaseurl =  http://p1node01.mno.gr/oracle_java\nenabled = 1\ngpgcheck = 0\n# scp /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo XXXedgeXX:/etc/yum.repos.d/\n```\nFinally on each edge node install the above packages:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum install jdk-1.8\n```\n## Step 2: Update the Repository with New RPMs\nDownload the desired version of Oracle Java 8 from\n[Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) or\n[Oracle Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and\nplace the RPMs inside `/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` of **pr1node01**. Login to\n**pr1node01** and update the repository with the new packages:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo --update .\n```\n## Step 3: Upgrade Java on Edge Hosts\n### Preparation\nBefore upgrading the edge nodes, their resources must be moved to other nodes and a backup\nof the old java be made. Login to each edge node:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# cp -rap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64/  /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n### Execution\nInside each edge node, update the java package using **YUM**:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum update java-1.8\n```\nCopy the old certificates into the new installation directory and run the update alternatives\ntool where you input the new version when prompted:\n```bash\n# cp -ap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts \\\n/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<new version>-amd64/jre/lib/security/\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\nIf everything is OK unstandby the node and check each wildfly instance's access and\nserver logs for the following:\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/server.log`: There are no undeployed WARs\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/access.log`: Everything is reporting HTTP 200 status\nDetailed wildfly information and management instructions can be found\n[here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/manage_wildfly.md).\n## Step 4: Rollback to Previous Java Version\nLogin to each edge node and downgrade using the update-alternatives and inputting the previous version:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```",

The job was re-executed in three intervals to work around memory constraints. Postgres monitoring tables were manually updated to show job success, and the pipeline was resumed from the appropriate downstream step using a modified master script.\njob_name: MergeBatch\ncomponent: Job\nStatus: Failed\nHost: dr1edge01.mno.gr\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox\n2. At the YARN UI search for `PRODREST` and sort by End date. You will find the failed application.\n3. From the UI we saw that Spark exited due to OOM errors.\n4. Using this [document](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch) we executed Merge Batch in 3 steps in parallel:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 00:00:00\" \"2022-02-28 12:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 12:00:00\" \"2022-02-28 18:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 18:00:00\" \"2022-01-03 00:00:00\"\n```\n5. We updated the monitoring postgres database in order for the entry to appear green in Grafana. You can get a success query for Merge batch from the log file of the master script and change the dates. To confirm resolution, verify that Grafana shows no failed MergeBatch jobs for 2022-02-28.\n6. We created a copy of the master script as `PRODREST` at `dr1edge01`.\n7. nside the copied script, we removed the pre-processing steps before the [Distinct join to Service Audit](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#distinct-join-to-service-audit) stage.\n8.

The columns of the detail tables are produced either from a non json column of the input table (eg. client_username) or from parsing the json fields request_text_data and response_text_data and extracting specific fields based on their name. When two fields have the same name then we will keep the greater value either for a number field or for a string based on lexicographic order.\nThese jobs are executed by the bank's scheduler.

Login to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `mtuser` with sudo\n2. Inspect logs of *CSI fix* flow. Nfgh that filename format is `CSI_fix_<mmddyyyy>_w<week>.txt` and that there is a 2 day delay between the export time and the exported data. In this case there was a problem with the file containing data for 2020-11-22 which was exported at 2020-11-24. So we checked the logs for 2020-11-24. \n```bash\ncd /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log\nless sai_csi.cron.20201124.log\n```\n3. Check if the source table contained data for the export date.\nIn `sai_csi.cron.20201124.log`:\n``` bash\nQuery: use `sai`\nQuery: select nvl ... from sai.cube_indicators_it where par_dt='20201122'\n...\nFetched 0 row(s) in 0.06s\nProblem with 20201122.\n```\n4. Check if the source table contains data for this date. Please nfgh that the source table is just a view of table `brond.cube_indicators`.\n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2458393,20201123\n```\n5. Identify Missing Data in brond.cube_indicators. Since 3 dates are missing 2020/11/20-22, we need to run the workflow that populates `brond.cube_indicators`. But first we have to make sure all its table dependecies are loaded. Execute the following queries in an impala-shell or an Impala editor in Hue and make sure not only that partitions exist for those dates but also that there are an identical amount of lines.\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_retrains_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20201118'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\n...\ncount(*),par_dt\n2499833,20201118\n2497948,20201119\n*2496522,20201120*\n*2497810,20201121*\n*2497480,20201122*\n2496932,20201123\n2497130,20201124\n2505791,20201125\n``` \nExecute the same query for tables:\n- brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp\n- brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq\n- radius.radacct_hist\n- brond.brond_retrains_hist\n- brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nThis confirms the root cause: the brond.cube_indicators table lacked data for these dates, resulting in empty CSI_fix exports.\n6. Rerun Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators for Missing Partitions. Run Cube_Indicators workflow. Login to Hue as intra and navigate to Workflows > Dashboards > Coordinators. Search for `Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators` and click on the coordinator to view its executions. Select **one** at a time of the executions that need to be repeated. Nfgh that `brond.cube_indicators` is populated with a 2 day delay so if we want to load data for 2020-11-20 we have to execute the workflow of 2020-11-22. Select the execution from the check box and click `Rerun`. \n7. After each workflow execution repeat the query of step 4 to verify that table has been loaded. \n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2454321,20201120\n2458393,20201123\n```\n8. Gather dates that need to be exported. As we saw in step 5 the source table was empty for 3 partitions: 20201120, 20201121, 20201122. The files produced for them was empty. Verify by checking `/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log`:\n```bash\n2020-11-21 09:01:39  CSI_fix_11212020_w47.txt  20201119  2453089\n2020-11-22 09:00:43  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  0\n2020-11-23 09:28:14  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  0\n2020-11-24 09:01:01  CSI_fix_11242020_w47.txt  20201122  0\n2020-11-25 09:03:13  CSI_fix_11252020_w48.txt  20201123  2458393\n```\n*CSI fix* provides a mechanism to avoid manual re-export of empty files. The most recent date of an empty file is stored in a table and automatically exported with the next execution. To view the date stored issue the query:\n```bash\nselect * from refdata.mediation_csi_load_info;\n...\nload_time,flow_name\nNULL,sai.mob\n20201122,sai.fix\n```\nSo we don't need to export manually date 20201122, only dates 20201120 & 20201121.\n9. Manually Export CSI_fix Files Using export_csi_fix.sh. Finally, to export the files we have to repeat step 1 and execute the export script **sequentially** for the desired dates + 2 days:\n```bash\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201122 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201123 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n```\nThis confirms the missing CSI_fix files were regenerated successfully with the expected number of lines.\n10. Afterwards check the reconciliation log file that files have been exported:\n```bash\nless /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log\n...\n2020-11-25 10:46:40  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  4915294\n2020-11-25 10:51:17  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  2457858\n```\nThe first one contains more lines as it includes dates 20201120 & 20201122.\n## Affected Systems\nabc Bigstreamer Backend\n---\ntitle: \"Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\"\ndescription: \"Instructions for manually executing the Cube Indicators Spark job from terminal on un1.bigdata.abc.gr, including how to pull the latest script, modify execution date, and run the submit script.\"\ntags:\n  - cube indicators\n  - spark job\n  - pyspark\n  - hdfs\n  - brond\n  - manual execution\n  - terminal\n  - big data\n  - intra\n---\n# Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\nThis guide explains how to manually run the Cube Indicators Spark job for missing dates from the terminal.

The issue affects both historical and streaming tables, with warnings appearing due to out-of-date or missing metadata. It includes steps for HDFS size verification, reviewing Impala table stats, running `compute stats`, and `refresh`, as well as caveats for high-frequency streaming tables like `sai.sms_raw`.\nThe following tables have potentially corrupt table statistics. Drop and re-compute statistics to resolve this problem. ->\nsai.voice_quality_hist,\nsai.sms_raw, \nsai.voice_raw,\nbrond.brond_retrains_hist,\nbrond.td_dslam_week,\nookla.ookla_android,\nookla.ookla_ios,\nookla.ookla_stnet,\ntemip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms,\ntemip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms\n## Actions Taken\nTables like sai.sms_raw ingest data every 5 minutes, which makes real-time statistics invalid or misleading.\n### HDFS Table Size Check\nRun the following commands on un2 as user `intra` to inspect HDFS directory sizes of the affected tables:\n```bash\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/sai.db/voice_quality_hist\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/brond.db/brond_retrains_hist\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/brond.db/td_dslam_week\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_android\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_ios\nhdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_stnet\n``` \n### Check Impala Table Stats\nReview current statistics for the affected tables via the Impala shell:\n```bash\nshow table stats  sai.voice_quality_hist               ;\nshow table stats  sai.sms_raw                          ;\nshow table stats  sai.voice_raw                        ;\nshow table stats  brond.brond_retrains_hist            ;\nshow table stats  brond.td_dslam_week                  ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_android                  ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_ios                      ;\nshow table stats  ookla.ookla_stnet                    ;\nshow table stats  temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms ;\nshow table stats  temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms   ;\n```\n### Recompute Statistics",

The main issue was that the provided keytab used deprecated `arc4-hmac` encryption, and the OS defaulted to using an incompatible KCM ticket cache. This blocked application authentication with error messages indicating missing keys. The problem was resolved by forcing a file-based ticket cache, removing the `sssd-kcm` service, and enabling support for weak crypto in `/etc/krb5.conf`.\n```\n/way4/DEVUSER.keytab does not contain any keys for DEVUSER@BANK.CENTRAL.mno.GR\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. The new server hosting the application is RHEL 8 instead of Solaris.

After that the klist output used a `FILE` cache, but the problem persisted.\nSince the OS problems were resolved we focused the keytab.\nFrom the server with `way4`\n``` bash\nklist -kte /way4/DEVUSER.keytab\n```\nOutput:\n```\nKeytab name: FILE:/way4/DEVUSER.keytab\nKVNO Timestamp           Principal\n---- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  0 01/01/1970 00:00:00 DEVUSER@BANK.CENTRAL.mno.GR (DEPRECATED:arc4-hmac) \n```\nThat DEPRECATED flag is not a good sign. \n4.

It also includes detailed troubleshooting steps for resolving SPN-related Kerberos preauthentication errors and replication failures across KDCs.\n# Manage IDM Replication\n## Setup\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been installed on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n### Force replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n## Troubleshooting\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n### A brief history of preauthentication\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### Troubleshooting Preauthentication Issues\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

This morning we reset the user's password because it had expired. It can connect normally with the credentials. Also let me know that the applications of the other users (Charisis, Ploskas) are running normally.\n## Actions Taken\n### 1. Validate LDAP Bind Account (t1-svc-cnebind)\n- Ssh to **unrstudio1**\n- Do an ldap search using `t1-svc-cnebind` as the following in order to check if `t1-svc-cnebind` password is still valid:\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=t1-svc-cnebind)'\n```\n-  In the above case, if you get an error that you can't connect with the ldap server, that means it has an expired `t1-svc-cnebind` password, so you will need to replace it with a new one.\n### 2. Update LDAP Bind Password in RStudio Connect Config\n- Check the configuration file below for the current ldap t1-svc-cnebind password & replace it with new **(Responsible for that abc Admin)**:\n```bash\nssh unrstudio1\nvi /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg\n```\n### Conclusion\nRStudio Connect applications for user `kmpoletis` failed due to expired `t1-svc-cnebind` LDAP credentials. Issue resolved by updating the bind password in the system configuration file. Other users remained unaffected.\n---\ntitle: How to Change OpenLDAP Manager Password\ndescription: Step-by-step instructions for changing the OpenLDAP Manager password on `kerb1` and ensuring replication with `kerb2` is functional.\nowner: kpar\nsystem: OpenLDAP\ncluster: BigStreamer\nservices:\n  - LDAP\nnodes:\n  - kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr\n  - kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr\ntags:\n  - ldap\n  - password\n  - openldap\n  - kerb\n  - manager\n  - authentication\n  - security\nstatus: verified\nlast_updated: 2024-05-01\nrelated_docs:\n  - KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx\n---\nThis procedure explains how to securely change the OpenLDAP Manager password on kerb1, update both the config and data databases via LDIF files, and verify replication and authentication using both CLI and the phpLDAPadmin web UI.\n# OpenLDAP Manager Password Change\nFor every ldasearch the password of `Manager` is [here](KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n## Step 1: Login to LDAP Node\nLogin into the primary LDAP node (`kerb1`) with root access.\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\n## Step 2: Generate New SSHA Password Hash\nUse `slappasswd` to create a new SSHA-encoded password for the LDAP Manager account.\n```bash\nslappasswd -h {SSHA}\n```\n## Step 3: Store the output \nThe output will be start with something like `{SSHA}xxxxxxx` \n## Step 4: Create LDIF Files to Apply Password Change\nCreate two LDIF files: one for the config database and one for the BDB (data) database.\n### 4a.

Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n### Backup\n1.

Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n### Update configuration\nUpdate RStudio Connect config file with new LDAP bind credentials and search base DNs\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n3.

Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n### Rstudio Lisence\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n### Delete user\nClean up a deactivated or duplicate user from RStudio Connect user base\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\nOutput must be something like below:\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no output.\n6.

For example:\n- Chrisostomos Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- Chrisostomos Charisis, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n6.

The issue was resolved through coordinated disk replacement, cache clearing, and RAID reinitialization using MegaCli64.\nThe following alert has appeared in Cloudera Manager (DR):\n```\nDataNode (dr1node02)\nData Directory Status\n```\n## Actions Taken\nThere are references from the similar issue [20220620-SD1951890.md](20220620-SD1951890.md).\nAfter investigation we saw that the problem occurred due to disk issue on dr1node02.\nWe communicated with Oracle and disk replacement was scheduled.\n> Ndef: that disk replacement perfomerd online so there was no downtime.\nWe followed the steps as described at [20220620-SD1951890.md](20220620-SD1951890.md) and [sync_mysql.md](sync_mysql.md), which include the following:\n1. Stopping the processes that specifically run at the disk slots `s1` and `s7` of the server `dr1node02`. On our case was the hdfs datanode and some yarn applications. We identified them with:\n2. Stopping the mysql slaves using the command:\n```bash\nmysql -u root -p\nSHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n```\n3. Ensuring that the no processes are running at the partitions with the following commands:\n```bash\nlsof /u02\n```\n```bash\nlsof /u08\n```\n4. Unmounting the two partitions, so the disks can be replaced.\n```bash\numount <mountpoint>\n```\n5. Once the disks have been replaced we ran the following command for both partitions:\n```bash\nbdadiskutility /u02\n```\n6. After running the command, we got the following error:\n```\nVirtual Drive <VIRTUAL_DRIVE_NUMBER> is incorrectly mapped.\n<TIMESTAMP> : Error executing 'MegaCli64 CfgLdAdd r0[<ENCLOSURE>:<SLOT>] a0'\n<TIMESTAMP> : Error code is 84 .

Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account and then to `dr1node01.mno.gr`\n2. Move to the process folder:\n```bash\ncd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/\n```\n3. Find the latest process and go to that folder. In our case is 12200-kudu-KUDU_TSERVER. So move to that folder:\n```bash\ncd 12200-kudu-KUDU_TSERVER\n```\n4. Use the keytab you just found in that folder:\n```bash\nkinit -kt kudu.keytab kudu/`hostname`\n```\n5. Check kudu cluster health and specifically for `prod_trlog_card_analytical` database in order to check if the wanted table is created.\n```bash\nkudu cluster ksck dr1node04.mno.gr dr1node05.mno.gr dr1node06.mno.gr | grep -i prod_trlog_card_analytical\n```\nAs you can see the `prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp` table is not created.\n**Optional**: You can also verify that from impala-shell running the following commands:\n- Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account\n- impala-shell -i dr1edge01 -k --ssl\n- `[dr1edge01.mno.gr:21000] default> use prod_trlog_card_analytical;`\n- `[dr1edge01.mno.gr:21000] default> show tables;`\nAs you can see the `prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp` table is not created.\n6. Login to CM DR with your pesonal account > Go to impala > Queries\n7. In the search bar type the following in order to find the query:\n`STATEMENT RLIKE '.*prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp'.*` and click on the query details for investigation.\nWe found that the query they try to run is the following:\n```bash\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS prod_trog_card analytical.opticash ispencing_atm_tmp\ncashp id, STRING NOT NULL\n, transaction date STRING NOT NULL\n,denom id STRING\n, cassette STRING\n, crncy id STRING\n, open Bal BIGINT\n, norm del BIGINT\n, norm rtr BIGINT\n, unpl_ del BIGINT\n, unpl_tr BIGINT\n, wthdrwls BIGINT\n, pre_wdrw BIGINT\n, deposits BIGINT\n, clos_bal BIGINT\n, bal_disp BIGINT\n, bal_escr BIGINT\n, bal_unav BIGINT\n, opr_stat STRING\n, excld_fl STRING\n‚PRIMARY KEY (cashp_id, transaction date, denom_id, cassette)\n) STORED AS KUDU\n```\nWe try to rerun the above query and we get the following error:\n```bash\nERROR: ImpalaRuntimeException: Error creating Kudu table 'prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp'\nCAUSED BY: NonRecoverableException: failed to wait for Hive Metastore notification log listener to catch up: failed to retrieve notification log events: failed to get Hive Metastore next notification: Thrift SASL frame is too long: 338.01M/100.00M\n```\n### Resolution\nAs a first step, let's try to fix `Thrift SASL frame is too long: 338.01M/100.00M` error.\n1. Login to Cloudera Manager in DR site with your personal administrative account:\n`Kudu > Instances > Click on Master > Select Tab Configuration`\n2. In `Search` box write safety valvue and at `Master Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve for gflagfile)` add th following flag:\n```bash\n--hive_metastore_max_message_size_bytes=858993459\n```\n>**Important Ndef**:  The above step with flag must be set at all three masters\n3. Restart the three kudu masters (one at a time)\n4. After rerunning the query the table is not still created but this time we get the following error: \n```bash\nSASL decode failed: SASL(-1): generic failure:\nwO706 15:44:11.242372 109675 hms_notification_log_listener.cc:130] Hive Metastore notification log listener poll failed: Not authorized: failed to ret\nrieve notification log events: failed to get Hive Metastore next notification: SASL decode failed: SASL(-1): generie failure:\nw0706 15:44:35.127687 109673 hms_client.cc:345] Time spent get HMS notification events: real 8.885s user 0.000s sys 0.228s\n```\n5. Restarting all Tablet Servers (dr1node01-10),one at a time, fixed the problem. \n**Before Restarting Tablets the following Flows must be stopped !!!**\n```\nPROD_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible\nPROD_Online_IngestStream\nPROD_IBank_IngestStream\n```\nStop the flows:\n>Ndef: We used following command because flows were working fine. Otherwise, we you should kill the application.\n```bash\nhdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\nhdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown _marker/\nhdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nWhen Tablets are all up and running make sure you start again the flows. \nVerify that Tablets and Kudu is up and running by checking graphs and CM UI (CM -> Kudu -> Charts Library)\nInformation about how to start flows can be found [here](http://https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/tree/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows \"here\")\nWe verified that the problem is fixed by running the querry and got Table has been created message.\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThis problem occurred due to dr1node07 disk replacement.\nPlease refer to *IM1893876* for more information.",

The `Upsert to HBase` stage that synchronises the `Visible` table caused an Impala problem during which Impala stopped to process this job as well as other requests.\n5. The problem is described below.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG.

From Cloudera Manager select Impala Service and check the Out of Memory Impala Queries Chart\nIn our case we had a large number of OOM quries between 23:00 and 02:00.\n2. Check for large queries in the corresponding time slot\nCloudera Manager -> Impala -> Queries\nSelect those that have a lot of Aggregate Peak Memory Usage from the filters on the left.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\nThe topology has been re-executed and is in running status. The analysis revealed that there was an Out of Memory problem in Impala due to some queries that ran between 23:00 and 02:00 and requested many MB of memory.\nThese specific queries are hindering the production process. Attached you will find the relevant screenshots.\nWe ask for your immediate actions as well as for the control of your own flows during the above period.\n```\n![PR_OOM_Impala_Queries.png](.media/PR_OOM_Impala_Queries.png)\n![PR_Queries1.png](.media/PR_Queries1.png)\n![PR_Queries2.png](.media/PR_Queries2.png)\n## Affected Systems\nPrimary Site IBank Batch\n---\ntitle: [DR][IBANK] Spark Waiting Batches Alert and IngestStream Topology Recovery\ndescription: Alert from Grafana about waiting Spark streaming batches on DR site for IBANK and ONLINE systems.

Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account\n2. Inspected `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`\n3. From the `Monitoring Alerts` check the graphs `spark waiting batches` to find which topology has delays`\n4. Open MobaXterm `dr1edge01` ssh with your personal account\n5. Execute `firefox`\n6. Click the `DR` bookmark\n7. Check the logs of failed spark topology.\n8. Login to `DR cloudera manager` with your personal account\n9. Go to `CHARTS-->KAFKA_KUDU_DISK_UTIL` and see if abnormal rates on disk util exists\n10. Using Firefox on `dr1edge01`, navigate to the Kudu tablet Web UI for each DR node and inspect the **Memory Usage (detailed)** section. If any tablet exceeds 90% memory usage, restart the affected Kudu tablet via Cloudera Manager or systemd.\n11. Check again the graphs `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`\n12. If the alert appeared `(in our case appeared on PROD_Online_IngestStream topology)` restart the specific topology\n13. Open a new tab on MobaXterm `dr1edge01` ssh with your personal account\n14. sudo -iu `PRODREST`\n15. yarn application -list | grep \"PROD_Online_IngestStream\"\n16. yarn application -kill `<application_id>`\n17. Start again the topology `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh`\n18. Check from Graphana again the graphs `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`.\n19. Go to spark jobs history and click running.\n20. Click `Running-->Online_Ibank_IngestStream-->Streaming`\n21. On the Spark Job UI for `Online_Ibank_IngestStream`, monitor the **Active Batches** section and ensure the count drops to 0, indicating no backlog.\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster Site IBANK\n---\ntitle: DR Cluster Service Disruptions Due to High-Complexity Impala Query\ndescription: DR Cloudera services appeared unhealthy, causing mass alerts and crashing some applications.

On logging into Cloudera Manager, all services were marked red. Some dependent applications had crashed due to this. Some of the applications crashed as well.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to grafana to make sure that the alert is about DR SITE. We noticed that there were alerts for IBANK Spark Waiting Batches but not for Visible which predisposes us for an issue with Kudu.\n![ibank_kudu_problem](.media/SD1949713/ibank_kudu_problem.PNG)\n2. Login to Cloudera UI for the DR Site.\n3. From `Charts>Impala Perf` we noticed increased resource commitment through Impala Pool Reserved and Threads charts.\n![Impala Pool Reserved](.media/Impala_pool_reserved.PNG)\n![Threads](.media/threads.PNG)\n4. From `Cloudera Manager>Impala>Queries` we searched for queries that took place at the time the problem raised. We found that the query with ID 6d44d9525a681fb8:5e536ffc00000000 had Threads:CPU Time 10.7h. Upon inspection through `Query Details` we saw that the query was of high complexity with conversions and comparisons with regex.\n![Query](.media/query.PNG)\n5. Through Cloudera logs, we noticed that the query impacted the services in the form of timeouts for Kudu and Hive due to slow communication with Sentry Service.\n![hive_problem](.media/SD1949713/hive_problem.PNG)\n![timeouts_kudu](.media/SD1949713/timeouts_kudu.PNG)\n![sentry_problem](.media/SD1949713/sentry_problem.PNG)\n6. The issue resolved itself once the query completed execution and the resource usage dropped. No manual recovery steps were required. We informed the client that it was due to a high complexity query ran by a normal user that resulted in an increased undertaking of resources.\n## Affected Systems\nDR Site\n---\ntitle: IBank_Migration Job Failure - Enrich SA from SA_old (Memory Limit Exceeded)\ndescription: The 'Enrich SA from SA_old' batch job on 30-03-2023 failed due to Impala memory exhaustion during execution on pr1node05; rerun manually after verifying service_audit partition and updating Grafana monitoring DB.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - ibank\n  - service_audit\n  - impala\n  - memory limit exceeded\n  - grafana\n  - enrichment\n  - upsert to hbase\n  - duplicates\n  - kudu\n  - hbase\n  - impala query failure\n  - retry job\n  - monitoring update\n  - prodrest\n  - im2180781\n  - pr1edge01\n  - date_20230330\n  - manual rerun\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: SD2180781\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: Impala memory limit exceeded on pr1node05 during join query for service_audit enrichment\n  resolution_summary: Reran enrichment script after verifying missing par_dt=20230330, then manually updated monitoring DB and ran HBase upsert and duplication report scripts\n  related_scripts:\n    - ibank_service_audit_insert_join_distinct.sh\n    - ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh\n    - report_duplicates_kudu_hbase_impala_STABLE.sh\n  related_tables:\n    - prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit\n    - prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream\n    - prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old\n  monitoring_updated: true\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - SD2180781 - Failed job at Grafana \n## Description\nOn 30-03-2023, the \"Enrich SA from SA_old\" job failed due to an Impala memory allocation error on pr1node05.\nThe following failed job appeared in Grafana:\n```\nApplication: IBank_Migration\nJob_name: Enrich SA from SA_old\nComponment: JOB\nDate: 30-03-2023\nStatus: FAILED\nHost: pr1edge01.mno.gr\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1.

We informed the customer to re-run the failed jobs and proposed to stop computing statistics for that table as they did not impact our application.\n``` text\n27/10/22 13:16:01 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nPlease rerun the flow steps that encountered a problem.\nWe are continuing to investigate the root cause of the problem.\n**Workaround**\n27/10/22 13:32:44 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nFollowing the previous answer, the compute statistics on the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table committed many resources on the Calatog Server and the query Coordinator (dr1node02), resulting in REFRESH/INVALIDATE METADATA operations experiencing long execution times and causing jobs to time out. After the compute statistics were completed, Impala released the resources and resumed.\nAs we have communicated in the past, from our perspective the statistics of the table are not necessary. Please let us know if we can disable the production of statistics for this particular table.\n**Resolved**\n```\n6. The changes for the statistics were implemented as part of [this ticket](obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster#180).\nDisaster Recovery Site Datawarehouse\n---\ntitle: DWH_IBANK EXPORT Batch Job Failed Due to Overlapping Execution\ndescription: The DWH_IBANK EXPORT batch job failed because it was manually started before the previous scheduled job completed, causing a conflict in execution on the DR site.

The `EXTRACT` step has 2 sub-steps: `Impala Insert` and `Sqoop Export`.\n3. Check logs:\nFrom `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:\n``` bash\nless /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log\n```\nIn this file for all flows that failed we see that the last log entry is the submission of the `Impala Insert` part of the `EXTRACT`, which was still running. This means that another query is hogging all resources for Impala and our flows are waiting to be executed.\n4. Login to Disaster Site Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.mno.gr:7183` and check for resource intensive Impala queries `Clusters > Impala > Queries`. The key resource here is memory as this is the only metric that can be defined in Resource Pools.\nThe query that created the problem was `COMPUTE STATS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`. Pictures are not included because Impala does not report statistics for the `COMPUTE STATS` queries, but given the size of the table and the time of execution it matched. This hypothesis was later confirmed when the same problem appeared on a later `COMPUTE STATS` execution.\n5. We informed the customer to re-run the failed jobs and proposed to stop computing statistics for that table as they did not impact our application.\n``` text\n27/10/22 13:16:01 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nPlease rerun the flow steps that encountered a problem.\nWe are continuing to investigate the root cause of the problem.\n**Workaround**\n27/10/22 13:32:44 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nFollowing the previous answer, the compute statistics on the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table committed many resources on the Calatog Server and the query Coordinator (dr1node02), resulting in REFRESH/INVALIDATE METADATA operations experiencing long execution times and causing jobs to time out. After the compute statistics were completed, Impala released the resources and resumed.\nAs we have communicated in the past, from our perspective the statistics of the table are not necessary. Please let us know if we can disable the production of statistics for this particular table.\n**Resolved**\n```\n6. The changes for the statistics were implemented as part of [this ticket](obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster#180).\nDisaster Recovery Site Datawarehouse\n---\ntitle: DWH LoanPayment Export Failed Due to Duplicate Primary Key in SQL Server\ndescription: The `EXPORT` job for the `LOAN_PAYMENT` component in DWH_IBank failed due to duplicate IDs in the staging table, violating SQL Server's primary key constraint during Sqoop export; resolved by reconstructing the partition and keeping only the valid record.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - dwh_ibank\n  - loan_payment\n  - export failure\n  - duplicate id\n  - sqoop\n  - sqoop export\n  - impala\n  - sql server\n  - primary key violation\n  - dwh_details_loan_payment\n  - staging table\n  - batch job\n  - impala shell\n  - yarn\n  - grafana\n  - im2070630\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2070630\n  system: mno BigStreamer DWH\n  root_cause: Two records with the same `id` and different timestamps were exported, violating SQL Server's unique constraint during Sqoop export\n  resolution_summary: A temporary table was created with deduplicated entries for `par_dt=20230125`, and the target table was overwritten; job was re-executed successfully\n  duplicate_id: 0E86AF89-F15C-4B78-8925-08ED8D237805\n  conflict_table: prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment\n  export_script: sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\n  export_component: LOAN_PAYMENT\n  failure_code: 1\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2070630 - Failed batch Job on Grafana\n## Description\nThe `EXPORT` batch job for `DWH_IBank → LOAN_PAYMENT` failed on 26/01/2023 with code `1`, due to a `PRIMARY KEY` violation in the external SQL Server system.\n```\nApplication: DWH_IBank\nJob Name: EXPORT\nComponent: LOAN_PAYMENT\nStatus: Failed\nDescription: Code:1\nThanks\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Root Cause Analysis\nAnalysis was performed in collaboration with @lmn and @iaravant\n1.

Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account and confirm that Datawarehouse Flows have failed from `Monitoring/Monitoring PR/DR` dashboard.\n2. All flows have failed with `Code: 6` which means that the control script has timed-out while monitoring the `EXTRACT` script. The `EXTRACT` step has 2 sub-steps: `Impala Insert` and `Sqoop Export`.\n3. Check logs:\nFrom `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:\n``` bash\nless /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log\n```\nIn this file for all flows that failed we see that the last log entry is the submission of the `Impala Insert` part of the `EXTRACT`, which was still running. This means that another query is hogging all resources for Impala and our flows are waiting to be executed.\n4. Login to Disaster Site Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.mno.gr:7183` and check for resource intensive Impala queries `Clusters > Impala > Queries`. The key resource here is memory as this is the only metric that can be defined in Resource Pools.\nThe query that created the problem was `COMPUTE STATS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`. Pictures are not included because Impala does not report statistics for the `COMPUTE STATS` queries, but given the size of the table and the time of execution it matched. This hypothesis was later confirmed when the same problem appeared on a later `COMPUTE STATS` execution.\n5. We informed the customer to re-run the failed jobs and proposed to stop computing statistics for that table as they did not impact our application.\n``` text\n27/10/22 13:16:01 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nPlease rerun the flow steps that encountered a problem.\nWe are continuing to investigate the root cause of the problem.\n**Workaround**\n27/10/22 13:32:44 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nFollowing the previous answer, the compute statistics on the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table committed many resources on the Calatog Server and the query Coordinator (dr1node02), resulting in REFRESH/INVALIDATE METADATA operations experiencing long execution times and causing jobs to time out. After the compute statistics were completed, Impala released the resources and resumed.\nAs we have communicated in the past, from our perspective the statistics of the table are not necessary. Please let us know if we can disable the production of statistics for this particular table.\n**Resolved**\n```\n6. The changes for the statistics were implemented as part of [this ticket](obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster#180).\nDisaster Recovery Site Datawarehouse\n---\ntitle: DWH_IBank LOAN_PAYMENT EXPORT Failed Due to SQL Server Timeout in Sqoop Eval\ndescription: The EXPORT batch job for LOAN_PAYMENT failed with code 6 because the `sqoop-eval` step timed out while connecting to SQL Server, preventing the export from starting; no MapReduce job was submitted.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - dwh_ibank\n  - loan_payment\n  - export job\n  - sqoop\n  - sqoop-eval\n  - grafana\n  - code 6\n  - batch failure\n  - sqlserver\n  - network io exception\n  - connection timed out\n  - yarn\n  - impala\n  - im2074270\n  - monitoring\n  - rerun required\n  - sched_export\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2074270\n  system: mno BigStreamer DWH\n  root_cause: sqoop-eval failed due to SQL Server connection timeout, causing the batch job to exit with code 6 before export could be launched\n  resolution_summary: Job was not executed; customer instructed to rerun after confirming SQL Server availability\n  failure_stage: sqoop-eval\n  sqoop_export_status: not executed\n  yarn_job_submitted: false\n  affected_component: LOAN_PAYMENT\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2074270 - Failed Batch Job on Grafana\n## Description\nOn 30/01/2023, the EXPORT batch job for the `LOAN_PAYMENT` component of the `DWH_IBank` application failed with **Code 6**, as seen in Grafana.\n```\napplication : DWH_IBank\njob_name : EXPORT\ncomponent : LOAN_PAYMENT\ndate : 30-01-2023\nstatus : FAILED\ndescription : code 6\nhost : -\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1.

The issue stems from physical user workloads (queries, jobs) monopolizing critical system resources—specifically on `dr1node03` where MySQL is hosted. This results in Spark topologies entering a stalled state due to delayed authorization responses from the overloaded MySQL service.\nThe following alert appeared in the grafana system:\n```\n[DR][IBANK] Spark Waiting Batches Alert\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. The following text has been sent to mno/PM and explains the problem, as well as the recommended actions:\n```text\nSpark Waiting Batches Problem: The first and most important problem we have is the \"Spark Waiting Batches\" which opens a ticket for this monitoring. This is due to physical user actions (queries/jobs) that occupy/bind production resources on the disaster site mainly. This results in there being no resources available for the MySQL process (a central point that the entire cluster has a dependency on), the service that does the authorization is unable to process its data in the database and thus causes a delay in the spark topologies until the \"permission denied\" error is resolved. The spark topologies, while up and running, are unable to process the data, as a result of which they continue to execute after the execution of the jobs that occupied the resources on the server where the MySQL service is located has finished. We do not take any action in this nor can we do anything and mno has asked us to close the ticket directly.\nSuggestion: Disable Impala Daemon and YARN Node Manager on dr1node03.mno.gr, pr1node03.mno.gr where the primary MySQL service is located. This will not affect our cluster workload as, as you will see in the attached screenshots:\n1. impala_mean.png: The average memory occupied by Impala Daemon is much smaller than the limit (150GB) that we have set even in the evening hours when all the flows \"close\" the previous day and the largest load is concentrated on the cluster.\n```\n![impala mean usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_mean.PNG)\n``` text\n2. impala_total.png: The total memory commitment from Impala cumulatively for all nodes is at its peak about 500GB less than the total available, which means that by removing a node there will still be room for resources even with the addition of new flows\n```\n![impala total usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_total.PNG)\n```\n3. yarn.png: throughout the day, the available yarn resources are sufficient even with the removal of more than one node\nThe above applies to both sites and the screenshots are from the Disaster site, where the most resources are reserved compared to the 2 sites. It is important as in this MySQL has a dependency on the entire cluster.\n```\n![yarn usage](.media/IM2099957/yarn.PNG)\n``` text\nBy monitoring the remaining nodes of the 2 clusters, we see how they can manage the workload at CPU levels and with the above proposal we will reduce the CPU levels on critical node03 which anyway uses increased CPU for cluster management processes.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nmno Disaster Site\n## Action Points\n- [Issue 66 – Resource contention on MySQL node (Disable roles)](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/66)  \n- [Issue 196 – Cluster role optimization for Spark performance](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/196)\n---\ntitle: Impala Connection Pool Exhaustion During HBase Upsert Job Due to Serial Execution on Coordinator\ndescription: The Impala daemon (pr1node04) was overloaded during execution of the Upsert to HBase stage for the IBANK Visible table due to forced single-node execution, resulting in blocked queries, high concurrent connections, and system health alerts; resolved by reverting script changes and disabling HBase quotas.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - impala\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala client connections\n  - impala coordinator\n  - hbase\n  - hbase quotas\n  - upsert to hbase\n  - ibank visible\n  - prodrest\n  - spark\n  - concurrency\n  - impala query failure\n  - cloudera manager\n  - pr1node04\n  - pr1node01\n  - resource bottleneck\n  - impala query logs\n  - impala role restart\n  - IM2097021\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2097021\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: Forced single-node execution of an Impala upsert query exhausted coordinator (pr1node04), blocking concurrent queries and triggering health alerts\n  resolution_summary: Cancelled the long-running query, restarted Impala daemons, removed serial execution flag, and reran the job with parallel execution enabled\n  affected_daemons:\n    - pr1node01\n    - pr1node04\n  related_jobs:\n    - /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh\n  customer_impact: live stream ingestion and production queries were stalled\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2097021 - Multiple Health issues on PR Impala\n## Description\nOn 02/03/2023 at 23:30, multiple Impala daemons across PR Site triggered health alerts in Cloudera Manager due to high concurrent client connections and pause duration warnings. The issue originated from a long-running query used in the IBANK Visible table upsert job, which was executed in single-node mode (via `set num_nodes = 1`). This forced the query to overload the coordinator daemon (pr1node04), which caused query blocking, client connection accumulation, and stalled streaming services.\nToday 02/03/2023 & 23:30 the Following alarms appeared on Cloudera:\n```\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node01)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node02)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node03)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node04)]\n[Pause Duration]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node05)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node06)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site \n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\n![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\n> Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well.\n### Mitigation\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\n1st way: From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\n2nd way: From the url that we monitor the query.\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond.\n### Resolution\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality.\n7. Upon investigation, we concluded that the change to `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` that stops the parallel execution of the query by Impala daemons (set num_nodes = 1) was the cause of the problem.\n8. We scheduled to rerun the `Upsert to HBase` stage the following day after reverting the script to use all Impala daemons for parallel execution.\n### Long-Term Fix\n9.  On 03/03/2023 \n- we disabled HBase quotas for ` PROD_IBANK` namespace on PR Site according to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/22263_mno_HBASE_TUNING.docx) MoP\n- we removed `set num_nodes = 1` from `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`\n- reran the script\n10. The script ran successfully\n## Action Points\n1. We opened [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/67) issue to investigate and deploy a permanent fix for running `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` alongside HBase quotas.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 00:49:29 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe root cause is the same as ticket SD2158913. The job that populates the visible table was canceled after consultation with the customer as it was affecting the live streams.\nThe job will be scheduled to be rerun after consultation.\n```\n---\ntitle: iBank_Migration Historical Batch Job Failed Due to Impala OOM",

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic.

In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n#### PR replication\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n\n```\n#### DR replication\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n```\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n### Spark Streaming Pipelines\nSpark topologies consume Kafka events and write them to Kudu and HBase, separating full stream and visible-only transactions.\nAfter being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream\nThis topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999).

IM2095966 - Failed Batch Job on Grafana\n## Description\nThe MergeBatch job for the IBank_Ingestion pipeline failed on 28/02/2023 on the PR Site with a Grafana alert. The failure occurred during the `JOB` component execution and was traced to Impala resource exhaustion caused by HBase write quotas and high data volume at end-of-month.\nThe following failed batch job appeared in the Grafana system:\n```\napplication :  IBank_Ingestion\njob_name : MergeBatch\ncomponent : JOB\ndate : 28-02-2023\nstatus : FAILED\ndescription :\nhost : pr1edge01.mno.gr\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. We identified the failed step using the alarm name. Steps `MSSQL Sqoop Import (Migration)` and `Insert to Service Audit` had been executed successfully. We rerun the `Merge Batch` according to [this](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch).\n2. The job had not completed at approximately 9.pm on 01/03/2023 we terminated the job after communication with the customer in order for the night flow to run without any problems. We scheduled to rerun the job in the following day after the completion of the daily MergeBatch.\n3. On 02/03/2023 we reran the job in 3 patches \n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 00:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\" \"2023-03-01 00:00:00\"\n```\n4. The `Upsert to HBase` stage that synchronises the `Visible` table caused an Impala problem during which Impala stopped to process this job as well as other requests.\n5. The problem is described below.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG. Poulas\n03/03/23 00:53:26 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe service audit has been filled on the PR Site. The job that fills the visible table is pending as it was canceled in the context of ticket SD2159021.\n02/03/23 15:56:38 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe execution on both sites started after the scheduled execution of the Merge Batch for 01/03/2023, which has been completed without a problem. At this time, the DR has processed until 18:00, while the PR has processed the data until 12:00. The executions on both sites are being monitored so that they can be resubmitted in case of a problem.\n01/03/23 21:11:19 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nFollowing our telephone communication, the job has been stopped and will be re-executed tomorrow in order to avoid problems with the evening streams.\n```\n---\ntitle: Impala Connection Pool Exhaustion During HBase Upsert Job Due to Serial Execution on Coordinator\ndescription: The Impala daemon (pr1node04) was overloaded during execution of the Upsert to HBase stage for the IBANK Visible table due to forced single-node execution, resulting in blocked queries, high concurrent connections, and system health alerts; resolved by reverting script changes and disabling HBase quotas.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - impala\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala client connections\n  - impala coordinator\n  - hbase\n  - hbase quotas\n  - upsert to hbase\n  - ibank visible\n  - prodrest\n  - spark\n  - concurrency\n  - impala query failure\n  - cloudera manager\n  - pr1node04\n  - pr1node01\n  - resource bottleneck\n  - impala query logs\n  - impala role restart\n  - IM2097021\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2097021\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: Forced single-node execution of an Impala upsert query exhausted coordinator (pr1node04), blocking concurrent queries and triggering health alerts\n  resolution_summary: Cancelled the long-running query, restarted Impala daemons, removed serial execution flag, and reran the job with parallel execution enabled\n  affected_daemons:\n    - pr1node01\n    - pr1node04\n  related_jobs:\n    - /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh\n  customer_impact: live stream ingestion and production queries were stalled\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2097021 - Multiple Health issues on PR Impala\n## Description\nOn 02/03/2023 at 23:30, multiple Impala daemons across PR Site triggered health alerts in Cloudera Manager due to high concurrent client connections and pause duration warnings. The issue originated from a long-running query used in the IBANK Visible table upsert job, which was executed in single-node mode (via `set num_nodes = 1`). This forced the query to overload the coordinator daemon (pr1node04), which caused query blocking, client connection accumulation, and stalled streaming services.\nToday 02/03/2023 & 23:30 the Following alarms appeared on Cloudera:\n```\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node01)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node02)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node03)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node04)]\n[Pause Duration]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node05)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node06)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site \n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\n![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\n> Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well.\n### Mitigation\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\n1st way: From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\n2nd way: From the url that we monitor the query.\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond.\n### Resolution\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality.",

Identify Missing Data in brond.cube_indicators. Since 3 dates are missing 2020/11/20-22, we need to run the workflow that populates `brond.cube_indicators`. But first we have to make sure all its table dependecies are loaded. Execute the following queries in an impala-shell or an Impala editor in Hue and make sure not only that partitions exist for those dates but also that there are an identical amount of lines.\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_retrains_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20201118'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\n...\ncount(*),par_dt\n2499833,20201118\n2497948,20201119\n*2496522,20201120*\n*2497810,20201121*\n*2497480,20201122*\n2496932,20201123\n2497130,20201124\n2505791,20201125\n``` \nExecute the same query for tables:\n- brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp\n- brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq\n- radius.radacct_hist\n- brond.brond_retrains_hist\n- brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nThis confirms the root cause: the brond.cube_indicators table lacked data for these dates, resulting in empty CSI_fix exports.\n6. Rerun Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators for Missing Partitions. Run Cube_Indicators workflow. Login to Hue as intra and navigate to Workflows > Dashboards > Coordinators. Search for `Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators` and click on the coordinator to view its executions. Select **one** at a time of the executions that need to be repeated. Nfgh that `brond.cube_indicators` is populated with a 2 day delay so if we want to load data for 2020-11-20 we have to execute the workflow of 2020-11-22. Select the execution from the check box and click `Rerun`. \n7. After each workflow execution repeat the query of step 4 to verify that table has been loaded. \n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2454321,20201120\n2458393,20201123\n```\n8. Gather dates that need to be exported. As we saw in step 5 the source table was empty for 3 partitions: 20201120, 20201121, 20201122. The files produced for them was empty. Verify by checking `/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log`:\n```bash\n2020-11-21 09:01:39  CSI_fix_11212020_w47.txt  20201119  2453089\n2020-11-22 09:00:43  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  0\n2020-11-23 09:28:14  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  0\n2020-11-24 09:01:01  CSI_fix_11242020_w47.txt  20201122  0\n2020-11-25 09:03:13  CSI_fix_11252020_w48.txt  20201123  2458393\n```\n*CSI fix* provides a mechanism to avoid manual re-export of empty files. The most recent date of an empty file is stored in a table and automatically exported with the next execution. To view the date stored issue the query:\n```bash\nselect * from refdata.mediation_csi_load_info;\n...\nload_time,flow_name\nNULL,sai.mob\n20201122,sai.fix\n```\nSo we don't need to export manually date 20201122, only dates 20201120 & 20201121.\n9. Manually Export CSI_fix Files Using export_csi_fix.sh. Finally, to export the files we have to repeat step 1 and execute the export script **sequentially** for the desired dates + 2 days:\n```bash\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201122 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201123 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n```\nThis confirms the missing CSI_fix files were regenerated successfully with the expected number of lines.\n10. Afterwards check the reconciliation log file that files have been exported:\n```bash\nless /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log\n...\n2020-11-25 10:46:40  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  4915294\n2020-11-25 10:51:17  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  2457858\n```\nThe first one contains more lines as it includes dates 20201120 & 20201122.\n## Affected Systems\nabc Bigstreamer Backend\n---\ntitle: IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch Failure Due to OOM - Recovery via Parallel Execution\ndescription: The IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch Spark job on DR site failed due to Out Of Memory (OOM) error.

The failure occurred during the `JOB` component execution and was traced to Impala resource exhaustion caused by HBase write quotas and high data volume at end-of-month.\nThe following failed batch job appeared in the Grafana system:\n```\napplication :  IBank_Ingestion\njob_name : MergeBatch\ncomponent : JOB\ndate : 28-02-2023\nstatus : FAILED\ndescription :\nhost : pr1edge01.mno.gr\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. We identified the failed step using the alarm name. Steps `MSSQL Sqoop Import (Migration)` and `Insert to Service Audit` had been executed successfully. We rerun the `Merge Batch` according to [this](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch).\n2. The job had not completed at approximately 9.pm on 01/03/2023 we terminated the job after communication with the customer in order for the night flow to run without any problems. We scheduled to rerun the job in the following day after the completion of the daily MergeBatch.\n3. On 02/03/2023 we reran the job in 3 patches \n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 00:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\" \"2023-03-01 00:00:00\"\n```\n4. The `Upsert to HBase` stage that synchronises the `Visible` table caused an Impala problem during which Impala stopped to process this job as well as other requests.\n5. The problem is described below.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG. Poulas\n03/03/23 00:53:26 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe service audit has been filled on the PR Site.

The issue originated from a long-running query used in the IBANK Visible table upsert job, which was executed in single-node mode (via `set num_nodes = 1`). This forced the query to overload the coordinator daemon (pr1node04), which caused query blocking, client connection accumulation, and stalled streaming services.\nToday 02/03/2023 & 23:30 the Following alarms appeared on Cloudera:\n```\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node01)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node02)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node03)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node04)]\n[Pause Duration]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node05)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node06)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site \n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\n![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\n> Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well.\n### Mitigation\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\n1st way: From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\n2nd way: From the url that we monitor the query.\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond.\n### Resolution\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality.",

Due to unavaliability of `nfs storage`(responisibility of the customer to maintain), `Host Monitor` service of Cloudera management services had `timeout` errors because couldn't collect metrics from each filesystem of the nodes.\n14. Customer informed that `nfs storage` caused the issue on both clusters and the unhealthy state of all services was not real because `Host Monitor` was not able to collect metrics in order to be appeared on `CM`. Also all flows ran without errors during the issue.\n15. Customer informed us that the `nfs` storage was full and after their actions it's ok. We checked the `CM` and all the services now is healthy.\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThis problem occurred due to `nfs` unavaliability.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\nThe issue was caused by the nfs storage used on the nodes of both clusters becoming full. This resulted in the host monitor of the cloudera management services timeouting as it was unable to collect metrics for each filesystem of the nodes.\nRelevant screenshots are attached showing the above causes of the issue.\nThroughout the issue, the flows were up and running as seen in grafana as it was a malfunction of the management services resulting in the incorrect image of all services in Cloudera Manager PR & DR respectively.\nAfter space was freed up on the nfs, both clusters returned to good health.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster/Primary Site\n---\ntitle: HDFS Block Count Alert on dr1node09 Due to service_audit_old Table Fragmentation\ndescription: An HDFS alert was triggered on the Disaster Site due to an excessive number of blocks on dr1node09 caused by unmanaged historical partitions in the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old table.

Investigation showed that the alert was caused by excessive block count due to the absence of a retention policy for the `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old` table in Hive. Manual purging of old partitions was performed to mitigate the issue.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to Cloudera Manager in DR and check the alarm\n2. It was a block count alarm on `dr1node09`\n3. Login to `dr1edge01` with your personal account and execute `firefox` to view the Namenode UI.\n4. Go to `https://dr1node02.mno.gr:50470` and from there in the tab `Datanodes`. Order the datanodes using the block count by desceding order to overview the situation.\n5. Change user to PRODREST and use HDFS command or Impala query to check how many partitions exist in `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. This is a big table that has no retention mechanism yet so its data are stored in many blocks. HDFS command is `hdfs dfs -ls /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old` and Impala query is `show partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. In either case observe how many `par_dt` directories exist.\n6. In our case there were at least 6 months in there so we informed mno. Sample customer notification:\n```text\nRegarding ticket SD1734269, the error shown in Cloudera Manager refers to a block count threshold exceeded on dr1node09 and is due to the increased number of blocks stored on the new nodes dr1node07-10. The impact on the datanode lies in the performance as the metadata for the blocks it has in memory does not fit.\nFrom the investigation we did in the HDFS data, we saw that there are many files in the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old table. Specifically, there is history in it from 01/03.",

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department.

In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site.

The applications that handle the HTTP calls are installed on the edge servers of both sites. At normal operation only one site is active. These applications are deployed on top of Wildfly instances. There are four sets of Wildfly installations one for the `ibank` flow and one for the `online` flow and two others for applications developed by mno. All application servers are managed by `supervisord` owned by `root` user.\n**DEV/QA Information**:\nThe information below are written for the Production enviroment. There is a development/QA environment that runs only on DR site. In case of a problem the paths are exactly the same if you substitute the `prod` with the `dev` prefix. For the networking part of the DEV/QA environment use the [Network Information](#network-information) chapter\n### Glossary\n- NetScaler: Loadbalancer managed by mno. It handles SSL offloading\n- VIP: Virtual IP of the Loadbalancer\n- SNIP: IP of the Loadbalancer that initiates the connection to Wildfly instances\n- Health check: Endpoint that the Loadbalancer uses to determine if a specific Wildfly instance is active.

Identify Affected Jobs and Confirm Failure via CDSW UI\n1. Connect with you personal ldap account in 'https://mncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr/'\n2. Go to last tab(admin).\n3. Select `Activity` tab.\n4. Inspect the Jobs in question.\nThe jobs are in `FAILED` status. The logs for the failed applications are missing.\n### 2. Investigate Job Pod Failures in Kubernetes\n5. Troubleshoot from the command line:\nFrom `mncdsw1` as root (use personal account and then sudo):\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -w -A # Wait a pod to fail (namespace should be like default-user-XXX)\n# After a while, a pod has failed, describe it\nkubectl describe pod -n default-user-XXX XXXXXXXX\n```\n### 3.

The logs and resources charts from Cloudera Manager did not indicate a specific reason for the restarts.\n8. After investigating HBase tables we identified that 2 tables from the `PROD_BANK` namespace although they have low traffic overall, they have high traffic per region. Since each region is hosted on only one Regionserver, so this application pattern creates hotspots on specific servers and does not utilize the whole cluster properly. Below you can find the charts that show this behavior.\nWorkload per region\n```sql\nselect delete_rate_across_hregions WHERE category = HTABLE and htabIeName RLIKE 'PROD*'\n```\n![DR_DELETE.PNG](.media/DR_DELETE.PNG)\n![DR_DELETE_12H.PNG](.media/DR_DELETE_12H.PNG)\n```sql\nselect get_rate_across_hregions WHERE category = HTABLE and htabIeName RLIKE 'PROD*'\n```\n![DR_GET.PNG](.media/DR_GET.PNG)\n![DR_GET_12H.PNG](.media/DR_GET_12H.PNG)\n```sql\nselect increment_rate_across_hregions + append_rate_across_hregions + mutate_rate_across_hregions WHERE category = HTABLE and htabIeName RLIKE 'PROD*'\n```\n![DR_WRITE.PNG](.media/DR_WRITE.PNG)\n![DR_WRITE_12H.PNG](.media/DR_WRITE_12H.PNG)\nUneven workload between Regionservers\n```sql\nselect read_requests_rate, write_requests_rate\n```\n![DR_LOAD_REGIONS.PNG](.media/DR_LOAD_REGIONS.PNG)\n![DR_LOAD_REGIONS_12H.PNG](.media/DR_LOAD_REGIONS_12H.PNG)\n## Our Ticket Response\n9. Inform the customer of the findings\n```\nThe problem did not occur today. Looking at the overall picture of HBase, we notice that its usage has increased significantly. Specifically, we see tables in the Namespace \"PROD:BANK\" with a high workload throughout the day and with an application-level configuration that creates uneven load distribution between Region Servers.\nYou should immediately proceed with the actions that have been suggested for benchmarking and tuning HBase as a service and the applications that use it in order to optimize its use.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster Site HBase\n---\ntitle: Internet Banking - Data Ingestion and Processing\ndescription: Complete documentation of the Internet Banking data pipeline: streaming ingestion, batch migration, Spark processing, Kafka, Wildfly, retention policies, Oozie jobs, and operational troubleshooting across DR/PR clusters.\ntags:\n  - ibank\n  - internet banking\n  - spark streaming\n  - kafka\n  - kudu\n  - hbase\n  - wildfly\n  - retention\n  - migration\n  - sqoop\n  - batch processing\n  - cron jobs\n  - troubleshooting\n  - monitoring\n  - cloudera manager\n  - impala\n  - data pipeline\n  - RAG\n  - BigStreamer\n---\n# Internet Banking\n## Stream\nProcesses user transaction events in real-time from Wildfly servers to Kafka, then through Spark Streaming to Kudu and HBase for persistent storage.\n### Wilfly Transaction Receiver\nWildfly applications receive HTTP POST requests with transaction events from Internet Banking backend servers and forward them to Kafka topics.\nUser generated events are sent to Wildfly instances installed at edge servers as HTTP POST requests.

SSH into **p1node01** and as root create the repository directories:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# mkdir -p /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n```\nDownload the desired RPMs from [Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html), place them inside\n`/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` and create the repository:\n```bash\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo .\n```\nSSH into one of the edge nodes, create the corresponding yum repo file and **scp** it into\nall other edge nodes:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxx@pr1edge01\n$ sudo -i\n# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo\n[oracle_java]\nname = oracle_java\nbaseurl =  http://p1node01.mno.gr/oracle_java\nenabled = 1\ngpgcheck = 0\n# scp /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo XXXedgeXX:/etc/yum.repos.d/\n```\nFinally on each edge node install the above packages:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum install jdk-1.8\n```\n## Step 2: Update the Repository with New RPMs\nDownload the desired version of Oracle Java 8 from\n[Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) or\n[Oracle Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and\nplace the RPMs inside `/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` of **pr1node01**. Login to\n**pr1node01** and update the repository with the new packages:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo --update .\n```\n## Step 3: Upgrade Java on Edge Hosts\n### Preparation\nBefore upgrading the edge nodes, their resources must be moved to other nodes and a backup\nof the old java be made. Login to each edge node:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# cp -rap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64/  /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n### Execution\nInside each edge node, update the java package using **YUM**:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum update java-1.8\n```\nCopy the old certificates into the new installation directory and run the update alternatives\ntool where you input the new version when prompted:\n```bash\n# cp -ap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts \\\n/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<new version>-amd64/jre/lib/security/\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\nIf everything is OK unstandby the node and check each wildfly instance's access and\nserver logs for the following:\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/server.log`: There are no undeployed WARs\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/access.log`: Everything is reporting HTTP 200 status\nDetailed wildfly information and management instructions can be found\n[here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/manage_wildfly.md).\n## Step 4: Rollback to Previous Java Version\nLogin to each edge node and downgrade using the update-alternatives and inputting the previous version:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\n---\ntitle: Postgres 14 Upgrade Procedure\ndescription: Detailed instructions for upgrading PostgreSQL from version 9.5 to 14 on PR and DR edge nodes in the BigStreamer environment, including data backup, repository setup, YUM installation, and rollback steps.\ntags:\n  -

Body starts with: `Could not perform radacct_enriched housekeeping on sftp server`\n  - Alerts that indicate general failures without specific cause:\n    - Body starts with: `Insert data failed` and then lists the status for each file\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- If an alert has been received, use the message from the e-mail to determine the root cause for the failure.\n  - For failures with Input SFTP server:\n    - Inform abc in order to check the Input SFTP Server\n    - If abc does not detect any problems, check connectivity:\n      From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n      ``` bash\n      su - radius\n      sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n      # Check for files\n      sftp> ls -l\n      ```\n  - For failures with Trustcenter SFTP Server:\n    - Check `unc2.bigdata.abc.gr` for any errors\n- If no alerts have been received or the problem is not specified determine the root cause for the failure with the following steps:\n  - Check for failed executions\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ```bash\n    curl --location --request GET 'http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800/monitoring/api/jobstatus/find?application=RADIUS&status=FAILED&operativePartition=<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.:20220518>'\n    ```\n    For additional query parameters check [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/common-dev/apps/monitoring/monitoring-devops/-/wikis/API-Functional-Spec#fields)\n    or check via the corresponding [Grafana dashboard](https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/J4KPyBoVk/radius-dashboard?orgId=1&from=now-2d&to=now)\n  - Check the logs for the failed execution.\n- After the underlying problem has been corrected the next execution of the flow will load any files that have been delayed or failed to be loaded in a previous execution.\n- If the customer requests to load specific files after they have been processed by the flow. **In order to avoid duplicate data we have to reload the whole partition.**\n  - Ensure the files are still available on the SFTP server\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n    # Check for files covering the whole date affected\n    sftp> ls -l *.LOADED\n    ```\n  - Suspend coordinator `Radius_Load_Coordinator`\n  - Drop partitions that were not properly loaded from following tables\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    kinit -kt /home/users/radius/radius.keytab radius\n    impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr -k --ssl\n    ```\n    -

Connect to SFTP server and rename files with filename timestamp equal to above-mentioned partition(s) and the same category:\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n    # For every file you need to reload\n    sftp> rename <filename>.LOADED <filename>\n    ```\n  - Resume coordinator `Radius_Load_Coordinator`\n## Kudu Housekeeping and Compute Statistics Flow\nThis secondary flow enforces retention on the Kudu table radius.radreference and recomputes Impala statistics for radarchive and radacct daily.\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Apply 5-day rention to<br>Kudu: radius.radreference]\n  B[Compute Impala Statistics for<br>radius.radarchive<br>radius.radacct]\n```\n- **User**: `radius`  \n- **Coordinator**: `Radius_Kudu_Retention_Coordinator` \n- **Workflow**: `Radius_Kudu_Retention_Workflow`\n- **HDFS path**: `/user/radius`\n- **Runs**: `once a day at 2:25 (UTC)`\n- **Config file**: `hdfs: /user/radius/Kudu_Retention_And_Compute_Stats/settings.ini`\n- **Logs**: From Hue go to `Job Browser -> Workflows` and filter with the workflow name\n**Alerts**:\n- Not monitored\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check the logs for the failed execution.\n- After the underlying problem has been corrected the next execution of the flow will apply the correct retention to the Kudu table and compute the missing statistics.\n---\ntitle: Radius Data Recovery and Ingestion after Cluster Downtime\ndescription: End-to-end recovery of missing hourly RADIUS and RADARCHIVE files due to system outage, including SFTP retrieval, ingestion via local `.trn` config override, and verification in hist tables.\ntags:\n  -

This document covers the radius and radarchive flow gaps and the manual restoration procedure used to load missing files into Hive hist tables.\nPlease immediately load all the data for all the hours and for all the flows (sai,vantage,radius etc) for the period of time the system was not working and run all the aggregated tables. We should also be sent a summary table with the relevant information so that we know if and in which streams there are data deficiencies.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `intra` with sudo.\n2. Check files that have not been ingested.

If the issue date is today (i.e., partition not yet generated), simply re-run the script as is: `/shared/abc/prometheus/bin/Cron_Prometheus_Load.sh >> /shared/abc/prometheus/log/Cron_Prometheus_Load.issue_date.log`\nIf the issue date passed then comment the `yesterday_dt=` and replace it with `yesterday_dt=<issue date -1>`. Then run the script ``/shared/abc/prometheus/bin/Cron_Prometheus_Load.sh >> /shared/abc/prometheus/log/Cron_Prometheus_Load.issue_date.log``\n### Step 5 – Validate Load via SQL\n5. When the script finished replace the old value of `yestarday_dt` on script.\n6. Checks:\n```sql\nselect count(*),par_dt from prometheus.table where par_dt >= 'issue_date -1' group by 2;\n```\n## Affected Systems\nabc Bigstreamer Prometheus Tables\n```\nprometheus.DWH22_hist - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH22_last - IMPALA\nrometheus.dwh3_hist - HIVE\nprometheus.DWH3_hist - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH3_last - IMPALA\nprometheus.dwh4_hist - HIVE\nprometheus.DWH4_hist  - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH4_last - IMPALA\nprometheus.dwh9_hist - HIVE\nprometheus.DWH9_hist - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH9_last - IMPALA\nprometheus.dwh11_hist - HIVE\nprometheus.DWH11_hist - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH11_last - IMPALA\nprometheus.dwh14_hist - HIVE\nprometheus.DWH14_hist - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH14_last - IMPALA\nprometheus.dwh17_hist - HIVE\nprometheus.DWH17_hist - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH17_last - IMPALA\nprometheus.dwh2_hist - HIVE\nprometheus.DWH2_hist - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH2_last - IMPALA\nprometheus.dwh43_hist - HIVE\nprometheus.DWH43_hist - IMPALA\nprometheus.DWH43_last - IMPALA\n```\n---\ntitle: Missing Partition in refdata.rd_cells_load Table on 2022-01-20\ndescription: Root cause analysis and resolution for missing data partition in the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table for 2022-01-20.
