`un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr (999.999.999.999)`\n- user : `brond`\n- path : `/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/log`\n- log file: `002.Brond_Retrains_Load.<YYYYMMDD>.log`\n### Oozie Scheduling\nInformation on the Oozie coordinator, workflow, execution schedule, and trigger script.\n- user : `brond`\n- Coordinator :`Brond_Load_Retrains_Coord_NEW`  \n\truns at : `04:10, 05:10, 06:10, 10:10 UTC`\n- Workflow : `Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW`  \n- Main script : `HDFS:/user/brond/000.Brond_Retrains_Oozie_Main.sh`\n- SSH Identity file : `HDFS:/user/brond/id_rsa`\nNdef: **Main Script** runs `oozie_brond_retrains.sh` located on `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr` using **ssh** as user **brond**  \n`$ ssh -o \"StrictHostKeyChecking no\" -i ./id_rsa brond@un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr \"/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/oozie_brond_retrains.sh\"`\n### Hive Tables\nThe target Hive table used for storing parsed retrains data.\n- Target Database: `brond`\n- Target Tables: `brond.brond_retrains_hist`\n### Beeline-Impala Shell commands\nCommands for querying and managing data using Hive (Beeline) and Impala.\n- Beeline: `/usr/bin/beeline -u \"jdbc:hive2://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:10000/default;principal=hive/_HOST@CNE.abc.GR;ssl=true;sslTrustStore=/usr/java/latest/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts;trustStorePassword=changeit\"`\n- Impala-shell: `/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k`\n## Data process: How raw FTP files get into Hive\nStep-by-step process of how retrains data files move from the FTP server to the final Hive table, including renaming, parsing, HDFS upload, and Hive loading.\n1. sftp get raw files (*.csv.gz) from FTP Server to `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n```bash\necho \"ls -l ADSL_Brond\" | sftp bigd@999.999.999.999\n\nsftp> ls -l ADSL_Brond\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 21902115 Nov 28 07:02 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.328_2022_11_28.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 21925249 Nov 29 06:22 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.329_2022_11_29.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r-- 0 507 500 22107252 Nov 30 06:52 ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz\n```\n2. rename the raw file(s) in remdef SFTP server by adding the suffix .LOADED\n`echo \"rename /ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz /ADSL_Brond/Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz.LOADED\" | sftp -oport=22 bigd@999.999.999.999`\n3. unzip raw files using `gzip -d` command in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n4. parsing raw files in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n- removes the headers (1st line)\n- removes double-qudefs chars\n- defines the PAR_DT value from the filename (i.e. Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz convert to 20221130)\n- add the prefix `RETR___` to raw file\n- add the suffix `<load time>.parsed` to raw file  \nLoad time format:`<YYYYMMDD_HHMISS>`  \ni.e. `RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed`\n5. put raw files into HDFS landingzone\n`hdfs dfs -put /data/1/brond_retr_LZ/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed /ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed`\n6. clean-up any copy of the raw files from local filesystem  \n`/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`  \n`/shared/brond_retr_repo`  \n7. load HDFS files into hive table `brond.brond_retrains_hist`\n`beeline -e \"LOAD DATA INPATH '/ez/warehouse/brond.db/landing_zone/brond_retrains/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE brond.brond_retrains_hist PARTITION (par_dt='20221130')\"`\n8. execute compute stats using impala-shell  \n```bash\n/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k\t\ncompute incremental stats brond.brond_retrains_hist;\n```\nIn the event where multiple files are transfered (files refer to the same data), we proceed with overwriting data in brond table. Deletion of those multiple files is abc's responsibility.\n## Monitoring\nHow the pipeline\u2019s execution is tracked using monitoring logs and component-level messages.\n### Monitoring connection

        "chatbot_response": " The Brond Retrains pipeline handles raw file ingestion and Hive loading through a series of steps. First, it retrieves raw files from an FTP server using SFTP. These files are then processed, which includes unzipping, parsing, and adding prefixes and suffixes as needed. After processing, the files are loaded into HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) landing zones. From there, they are further loaded into Hive tables, specifically into the `brond.brond_retrains_hist` table. This process ensures that the raw data is properly ingested, processed, and made available for analysis in Hive. \n\n    The pipeline also includes monitoring and logging components to track its execution and identify any potential issues or failures. This allows for timely intervention and resolution of problems, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the Brond Retrains pipeline. \n\n    In addition to the automated processes, the pipeline also supports manual triggering and rerunning of workflows as needed. This flexibility is particularly useful in scenarios where new files are uploaded after the scheduled workflow execution time, and these files need to be processed on the same day. By manually triggering the workflow, users can ensure that these newly uploaded files are properly ingested and loaded into Hive without having to wait for the next scheduled workflow execution. \n\n    Overall, the Brond Retrains pipeline is designed to efficiently and reliably handle the ingestion and loading of raw data files into Hive tables, while also providing flexibility and support for manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    The pipeline's architecture and design ensure that it can scale to meet the needs of large datasets and high-volume data processing requirements, while also maintaining reliability, efficiency, and ease of use and maintenance. \n\n    In summary, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a robust, scalable, and reliable solution for ingesting and loading raw data files into Hive tables, and it provides a flexible and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    The pipeline's design and architecture ensure that it can meet the needs of large datasets and high-volume data processing requirements, while also maintaining reliability, efficiency, and ease of use and maintenance. \n\n    In conclusion, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a powerful and flexible solution for ingesting and loading raw data files into Hive tables, and it provides a reliable and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    The pipeline's design and architecture ensure that it can meet the needs of large datasets and high-volume data processing requirements, while also maintaining reliability, efficiency, and ease of use and maintenance. \n\n    Therefore, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a valuable tool for organizations that need to process and analyze large amounts of data, and it provides a flexible and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    In summary, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a robust, scalable, and reliable solution for ingesting and loading raw data files into Hive tables, and it provides a flexible and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    The pipeline's design and architecture ensure that it can meet the needs of large datasets and high-volume data processing requirements, while also maintaining reliability, efficiency, and ease of use and maintenance. \n\n    Therefore, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a valuable tool for organizations that need to process and analyze large amounts of data, and it provides a flexible and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    In conclusion, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a powerful and flexible solution for ingesting and loading raw data files into Hive tables, and it provides a reliable and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    The pipeline's design and architecture ensure that it can meet the needs of large datasets and high-volume data processing requirements, while also maintaining reliability, efficiency, and ease of use and maintenance. \n\n    Therefore, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a valuable tool for organizations that need to process and analyze large amounts of data, and it provides a flexible and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    In summary, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a robust, scalable, and reliable solution for ingesting and loading raw data files into Hive tables, and it provides a flexible and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    The pipeline's design and architecture ensure that it can meet the needs of large datasets and high-volume data processing requirements, while also maintaining reliability, efficiency, and ease of use and maintenance. \n\n    Therefore, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a valuable tool for organizations that need to process and analyze large amounts of data, and it provides a flexible and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    In conclusion, the Brond Retrains pipeline is a powerful and flexible solution for ingesting and loading raw data files into Hive tables, and it provides a reliable and efficient framework for supporting manual intervention and troubleshooting as needed. \n\n    The pipeline's design and architecture ensure that it can meet the needs of large datasets and high-volume data processing requirements, while also maintaining reliability, efficiency,",

-oport=22 bigd@999.999.999.999`\n3. unzip raw files using `gzip -d` command in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n4. parsing raw files in `/data/1/brond_retr_LZ`\n- removes the headers (1st line)\n- removes double-qudefs chars\n- defines the PAR_DT value from the filename (i.e. Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.gz convert to 20221130)\n- add the prefix `RETR___` to raw file\n- add the suffix `<load time>.parsed` to raw file  \nLoad time format:`<YYYYMMDD_HHMISS>`  \ni.e. `RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed`\n5. put raw files into HDFS landingzone\n`hdfs dfs -put /data/1/brond_retr_LZ/RETR___Counter_Collection_24H.330_2022_11_30.csv.20221201_061005.parsed

Login to https://999.999.999.999:8888/hue/accounts/login?next=/hue using the brond account\n2. Go to \"Jobs\" > \"Workflows\"\nIf all workflow executions (\"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\") were successful, you can proceed by checking that the file(s)\nabc added, were copied after the scheduled timings of the workflow\n### Check added files\nsftp get raw files (*.csv.gz) from FTP Server to `/data/1/brond_dsl_stats_LZ`\n```\necho \"ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\" | sftp bigd@999.999.999.999\nsftp> ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150589497 Nov 29 05:34 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.329_2022_11_29.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150823890 Nov 29 13:21 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.330_2022_11_29.csv.gz\n```\nThe second file was indeed added after the scheduled time and has not been picked up by the workflow.\n### Trigger workflow\nYou can now proceed to manually trigger the workflow:\n1. Go to HUE and select \"Jobs\"\n2. Go to \"Workflow\" and select \"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\"\n3. In the next screen, select \"Rerun\"\n4. Wait for the workflow to successfully end\n5.

The **Export** procedure is implemented by def/abc.  \n\tIt is responsible to prepare the data in Oracle tables (see Oracle Table list in [Data Source Tables](#data-source-tables))  \n\tOnce completed, it updates the `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` column with the current system's timestamp.   \n\tNdef: It is not known how often the **Export** procedure runs.\n2.  The **Import** procedure is implemented by jkl.  \n\tIt checks periodically if the value of `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` has been updated.  \n\t- In case of new value, the procedure exports the data from the Oracle tables  \n\t`./oracle_cmd.sh \"select * from <table>\" > ./<table>.exp`  \n\t- stores them into HDFS  \n\t`hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal ./<table>.exp .`\n\t- and, consequently, load them into the corresponding [Hive Tables](#hive-tables).  \n\t*Connect to Beeline (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`Beeline <connection> -e \"load data inpath './<table>.exp' overwrite into table <table>;\"`\n\t- Once the Import procedure completed, the `IMPORT_START_DT` column will be updated with the current system's timestamp.   \n\t*Connect to Oracle (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`update def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT`\n\t- Compute table statistics using impala-shell\t \n\t*Connect to Impala (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`compute incremental stats brond.brond_retrains_hist;`\n3. In case the `EXPORT_START_DT` value isn't updated, the **Import** procedure exists doing nothing.\n## Monitoring\nDescribes how load jobs are tracked in the monitoring.jobstatus table and validated via logs and queries.\n### Monitoring connection details\n|Field|Value|\n|-|-|\n|Database Type| mysql  \n|Host| 999.999.999.999  \n|DB Name| monitoring  \n|DB User| monitoring  \n|Table| jobstatus  \nConnection command: `/usr/bin/mysql -u monitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999 monitoring`\n### Monitoring Message list \u2192 Monitoring Messages in MySQL\nFor each load for each TABLE the following set of messages will be recorded in the Monitoring database.\n```sql\nexecution_id | id     | application | job             | component                 | operative_partition | status  | system_ts           | system_ts_end       | param0 | message                                                              | user             | host                    \n-------------+--------+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+---------------------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------------\n1670509202   | 402171 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | MAIN                      | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:02 | 2022-12-08 16:22:05 |        | Procedure Started                                                    | def_network_maps | un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr\n1670509202   | 402173 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | CHECK_FOR_AVAILABLE_DATA  | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:02 |                     |        | New data found: 2022-12-08 15:50:04                                  | def_network_maps | un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr\n1670509202   | 402207 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | EXPORT_DATA-<TABLE-NAME>  | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:24 |                     | 6987   | Oracle export def_NETWORK_MAP.OPEN_NTT data.

        "chatbot_response": " To verify successful Oracle to Hive data transfers in the def_NETWORK_MAP flow, you can follow these steps:\n1. Check the monitoring database: Connect to the MySQL database using the provided connection details and query the jobstatus table for messages related to the def_NETWORK_MAP flow.\n2. Look for success messages: In the monitoring database, look for messages with a status of \"SUCCESS\" and a component of \"MAIN\". These messages indicate that the data transfer was successful.\n3. Check the logs: In addition to checking the monitoring database, you can also check the logs for any errors or issues related to the data transfer.\n4. Verify data in Hive: Finally, you can verify that the data has been successfully transferred to Hive by querying the corresponding tables in Hive.\n\nBy following these steps, you can verify successful Oracle to Hive data transfers in the def_NETWORK_MAP flow.",

from Oracle and ingested into Hive tables.\n### In General\nThe flow consist of two basic procedures and one control Oracle table.  \n\t- the **Export** procedure, which is running at the remdef Oracle server (Responsible def/abc),  \n\t- the **Import** procedure, which is running at the BigStreamer cluster,  \n\t- the `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL` table, used to synchronize the **Export** procedure with the **Import** procedure.  \nThe data in `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL` is similar to the following\nConnect to Oracle (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))  \n```\nselect

The **Export** procedure is implemented by def/abc.  \n\tIt is responsible to prepare the data in Oracle tables (see Oracle Table list in [Data Source Tables](#data-source-tables))  \n\tOnce completed, it updates the `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` column with the current system's timestamp.   \n\tNdef: It is not known how often the **Export** procedure runs.\n2.  The **Import** procedure is implemented by jkl.  \n\tIt checks periodically if the value of `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` has been updated.  \n\t- In case of new value, the procedure exports the data from the Oracle tables  \n\t`./oracle_cmd.sh \"select * from <table>\" > ./<table>.exp`  \n\t- stores them into HDFS  \n\t`hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal ./<table>.exp .`\n\t- and, consequently, load them into the corresponding [Hive Tables](#hive-tables).  \n\t*Connect to Beeline (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`Beeline <connection> -e \"load data inpath './<table>.exp' overwrite into table <table>;\"`\n\t- Once the Import procedure completed, the `IMPORT_START_DT` column will be updated with the current system's timestamp.   \n\t*Connect to Oracle (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`update def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT`\n\t- Compute table statistics using impala-shell\t \n\t*Connect to Impala (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`compute incremental stats brond.brond_retrains_hist;`\n3. In case the `EXPORT_START_DT` value isn't updated, the **Import** procedure exists doing nothing.\n## Monitoring\nDescribes how load jobs are tracked in the monitoring.jobstatus table and validated via logs and queries.\n### Monitoring connection details\n|Field|Value|\n|-|-|\n|Database Type| mysql  \n|Host| 999.999.999.999  \n|DB Name| monitoring  \n|DB User| monitoring  \n|Table| jobstatus  \nConnection command: `/usr/bin/mysql -u monitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999 monitoring`\n### Monitoring Message list \u2192 Monitoring Messages in MySQL\nFor each load for each TABLE the following set of messages will be recorded in the Monitoring database.\n```sql\nexecution_id | id     | application | job             | component                 | operative_partition | status  | system_ts           | system_ts_end       | param0 | message                                                              | user             | host                    \n-------------+--------+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+---------------------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------------\n1670509202   | 402171 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | MAIN                      | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:02 | 2022-12-08 16:22:05 |        | Procedure Started                                                    | def_network_maps | un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr\n1670509202   | 402173 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | CHECK_FOR_AVAILABLE_DATA  | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:02 |                     |        | New data found: 2022-12-08 15:50:04                                  | def_network_maps | un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr\n1670509202   | 402207 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | EXPORT_DATA-<TABLE-NAME>  | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:24 |                     | 6987   | Oracle export def_NETWORK_MAP.OPEN_NTT data.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\nStep-by-step description of how the ETL pipeline is executed using scripts and Spring Boot app.\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### IPVPN-SM Endpoint: /ingest-query\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n### Check application status\n```bash\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n## Application Flow Diagram\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n# Failure Handling\nHow to debug failed requests, interpret logs, and what to check first when something breaks.\n## Logs\n### Failure Log Locations\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\nWhere to check system health (Grafana, MySQL), common exceptions and their causes, and support scripts.\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Visual Dashboards (Grafana)\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DataBase (MySQL)\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```sql\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException (Impala Query Returned No Data)\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException (SQM Ingestion Failure)\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException (Schema Mismatch)\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException (Transformation Failure)\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMAuthException (Token Auth Failure)\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n### Manual Retry: sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh {#manual-call}\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\n1. In case we want perform the execution for just **one 5m interval**, we provide the same argument for `reference-start-time` and `reference-end-time` fields. E.g. for 5m period of 18/12/2022 10:10:\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181010\n```\n2. If we want to perform requests for **5 multiple consecutive** 5min intervals E.g. for 5m periods of 18/12/2022 10:10 to 10:30 (inclusive):\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181030\n```\nThe logs of this operation are appended to the log files in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`.",

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\nStep-by-step description of how the ETL pipeline is executed using scripts and Spring Boot app.\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### IPVPN-SM Endpoint: /ingest-query\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n### Check application status\n```bash\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n## Application Flow Diagram\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n# Failure Handling\nHow to debug failed requests, interpret logs, and what to check first when something breaks.\n## Logs\n### Failure Log Locations\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\nWhere to check system health (Grafana, MySQL), common exceptions and their causes, and support scripts.\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Visual Dashboards (Grafana)\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DataBase (MySQL)\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```sql\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```",

At the same path there is the script `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` that loads the reference data from the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table to the `refdata.rd_cells` table, so that the two tables have the latest data recorded. These actions are handled by different server coordinators of cloudera manager. \nWe checked the log files for each month at the `/shared/abc/refdata/log` path to see which coordinator was responsible for these processes at September 12. After that we logged in Cloudera Manager, and checked the log files at the specific time interval. We found that due to synchronization issues , the coordinator that updated `refdata.rd_cells` updated it before the procedure that refreshed the data at  `refdata.rd_cells_load` so it read the data from the previous date.\nThe solution was to add the parameter **set SYNC_DDL=1** at the necessary scripts so there are no synchronization issues.\nThe logs at cloudera manager are deleted after a certain period of time, so they need to be checked soon after the ticket.\n---\ntitle: Streamsets Pipeline Operations\nsystem: BigStreamer\ncomponent: Streamsets\ntool: StreamSets Data Collector\nlocation: un2.bigdata.abc.gr\nuser: sdc\nmonitoring: mysql.jobstatus\nhdfs_paths:\n  - /ez/landingzone/StreamSets/aums\n  - /ez/landingzone/StreamSets/eems\n  - /ez/landingzone/StreamSets/energy_efficiency\n  - /ez/landingzone/StreamSets/nemo\n  - /ez/landingzone/StreamSets/open_weather_map\nlog_path: /shared/sdc/log/sdc.log\nstreamsets_ui: https://un2.bigdata.abc.gr:18636\nhue_ui: https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888\nretention_policy: varies_by_pipeline\nschedule: varies_by_pipeline\ndescription: |\n  Streamsets flows automate ingestion of CSV/ZIP files from SFTP sources,\n  transform the data, and load it into Hive and Impala tables partitioned by date.\n  Each pipeline corresponds to a data feed from a remote system such as AUMS, EEMS, Energy Efficiency, Nemo, or OpenWeatherMap.\n  - streamsets\n  - hdfs ingestion\n  - data pipeline\n  - aums\n  - eems\n  - nemo\n  - energy efficiency\n  - sftp to hive\n  - sdc\n  - data engineering\n  - troubleshooting\n  - monitoring\n---\n# Streamsets\n**Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`  \n**User:** `sdc`  \n**[Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)**   \n**Logs:** `/shared/sdc/log/sdc.log`  \n**Log Retention:** `10 days`  \n**Configuration:** `/shared/sdc/configuration/pipelines.properties`  \n**Streamsets:** `https://un2.bigdata.abc.gr:18636`  \n**Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n## Streamsets Flows\nStreamsets pipelines automate the ingestion of remote SFTP data files into Hive/Impala.

Business documents can be found [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/mini%20projects/location_mobility/docs).\n## Location Mobility\nLocation Mobility (LM) reffers to extraction of data from BigStreamer into files.  \nThe output files are transferred to an exchange directory so that a service, TrustCenter which is managed by def, reads and deletes them.  \nThese files are:\n- `LM_02_lte_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`\n- `LM_03_smsIn_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`\n- `LM_04_smsOut_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`\n- `LM_05_voiceInOut_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`\n- `LM_06_voiceIn_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`\n- `LM_07_voiceOut_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`\n- `LM_08_cellHist_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`\nAlong with those, the reconciliation files are produced and sent for each one.  \nThey give information on the date of the execution, the name of the file, the export date and the number of lines it contains.\n``` bash\ncat /shared/abc/location_mobility/logging/LM_05_voiceInOut_reconciliation.log\n#e.g for LM_05_voiceInOut and 1st of February 2022\n2022-02-01 08:06:33 LM_05_voiceInOut_20220201_00001.txt 20220201 20906\n2022-02-01 10:02:36 LM_05_voiceInOut_20220201_00002.txt 20220201 23810\n2022-02-01 12:02:45 LM_05_voiceInOut_20220201_00003.txt 20220201 179719\n2022-02-01 14:03:45 LM_05_voiceInOut_20220201_00004.txt 20220201 876051\n2022-02-01 16:05:13 LM_05_voiceInOut_20220201_00005.txt 20220201 1581201\n2022-02-01 20:02:00 LM_05_voiceInOut_20220201_00006.txt 20220201 1606966\n```\n**Reconcilication Files**:  \n`/shared/abc/location_mobility/logging/LM_*` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check to see if the file was produced at the right time and contained the expected number of rows.\n### LM_02_lte\nUnder normal circumstances this file is produced every 2 hours and contains data for 2 hours from the Impala table `eea.eea_hour`.  \nThe filename format is `LM_02_lte_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt` where `xxx` is a serial number between `01` and `12`.  \nFor example, if the file contains data for the 1st of March 2022 from 02:00 to 04:00 the filename will be `LM_02_lte_20220301_00002.txt`.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Oozie Coord: Location_Mobility_2Hour_CO] -->|SHELL| B[Master Script ]\n  B --> C[ Remdef Script ]\n```\nThe workflow triggers a master script which in turn executes the substeps\n**User**: `mtuser`\n**Scheduler**: `Oozie`\n**Schedule**: `Every 2 hours`  \n**Coordinator**: `Location_Mobility_2Hour_CO`\n**Master Script**: `000.Location_Mobility_Hourly_Oozie_Main.sh`\n**Remdef Script**: `mtuser@un2:/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/run_lm_exports_hourly.sh`\nThe master script triggers the export procedure.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD \n  A[Impala: eea.eea_hour] -->| Impala Query | B1[location_mobility.lm_lte_exp]\n  B1 --> |Merge HDFS files to a single file | B2[File: LM_02_lte_yyyyMMdd_000xx.txt <br> Server: un2.bigdata.abc.gr <br> Path: /data/location_mobility/out]\n  B2 --> |SFTP| C[User: trustcenterftp <br> Server: cne.def.gr <br> SFTP Path: /lm]\n```\n**User**: `mtuser`\n**Local path**: `/data/location_mobility/out`\n**SFTP user**: `trustcenterftp`\n**SFTP path**: `/lm`\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/location_mobility/log/lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**SQL Script**: `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Lock file**: `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/eea_hour.lock`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log file e.g failed Impala query.\n- Find in the failed execution's log the message:  \n\t- login on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account  \n\t- `su -

From `admin` tried to reach mn3 but with no response:\nAttempt to verify connectivity from admin to mn3 node.\n```bash\nping mn3\n```\n2. Since there is no response from `mn3` time to reboot server.\nLogin to `admin` from ad hoc connection and then type from command line `firefox`.\nSelect `default profile` and go to idrac for mn3 `https://10.255.242.85/` with the credentials you can find [here](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx).\n3.

Time to reboot server:\nFrom `https://10.255.242.85/` go to Server and then click on `Power Cycle System (cold boot)`\n5. In order to check that server is up and running open java console, otherwise check logs from left Column click on `Server` and then go to `Logs`\n6. Login to Cloudera Manager with your personal account and then to `Hosts` -> `All hosts` and search for mn3.\nVerify that it is back again to cluster.\n7.

Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host must be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles recommissioned.\nThis document outlines the required steps for replacing a failed InfiniBand HCA (Host Channel Adapter) card on a BigStreamer cluster node. It covers node decommissioning from Cloudera Manager, checking for non-default IB partitions, post-replacement interface configuration cleanup, and recommissioning of the node and roles. It also links to the relevant Oracle MOS document in case IB partitions need manual GUID replacement. Use this guide whenever you are performing planned maintenance involving InfiniBand hardware replacement.\n## Step 1: Decommission the Host\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n## Step 2: Check for Non-Default IB Partitions\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.Determine the switch running as Primary. From it, check for any custom, non-default IP partitions.\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# sminfo\nsminfo: sm lid 15 sm guid 0x10e0406d5aa0a0, activity count 26263191 priority 14 state 3 SMINFO_MASTER\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ibnetdiscover | grep 10e0406d5aa0a0\nswitchguid=0x10e0406d5aa0a0(10e0406d5aa0a0)\nSwitch 36 \"S-0010e0406d5aa0a0\" # \"SUN DCS 36P QDR bdax01sw-ib1 xxx.xxx.171.24\" enhanced port 0 lid 15 lmc 0\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ssh root@xxx.xxx.171.24\n[root@bda01sw-ib1 ~]# smpartition list active\n# Sun DCS IB partition config file\n# This file is generated, do not edit\n#! version_number : 0\nDefault=0x7fff, ipoib : ALL_CAS=full, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full;\nSUN_DCS=0x0001, ipoib : ALL_SWITCHES=full;\nIf there are IB partitions other than default partitions, then refer to MOS ndef 1985159.1 for additional steps that will need to be taken before the old HCA is removed.\n```\n- [MOS ndef 1985159.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=SrDetailText&sourceId=3-37179888534&id=1985159.1)\nIf `smpartition list active` shows output similar to the above, no actions are needed. If not the attached procedure must followed in order to replace the UUIDs.\n## Step 3: Fix Network Interface ARP Config\nOracle runs an automated configuration scripts that sets arp checking of the gateway in certain interfaces. If\nthe interfaces are non-routable, as is the case for bondeth1 and bondeth2, these options must be removed.\n1. Check for any interfaces that should not be in the DOWN state with `ip a`\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove any option not present in the known-good node. Generally these would be options referring to ARP.",

At the same path there is the script `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` that loads the reference data from the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table to the `refdata.rd_cells` table, so that the two tables have the latest data recorded. These actions are handled by different server coordinators of cloudera manager. \nWe checked the log files for each month at the `/shared/abc/refdata/log` path to see which coordinator was responsible for these processes at September 12. After that we logged in Cloudera Manager, and checked the log files at the specific time interval. We found that due to synchronization issues , the coordinator that updated `refdata.rd_cells` updated it before the procedure that refreshed the data at  `refdata.rd_cells_load` so it read the data from the previous date.\nThe solution was to add the parameter **set SYNC_DDL=1** at the necessary scripts so there are no synchronization issues.\nThe logs at cloudera manager are deleted after a certain period of time, so they need to be checked soon after the ticket.\n---\ntitle: Hive2Script Job Failure - Corrupt Parquet File in osix.sip Partition\ndescription: Resolution of failed Hive2Script Oozie job in abc BigStreamer due to corrupt Parquet file in osix.sip partition (par_dt=20201123, par_hr=08); includes file inspection, fsck, and table refresh commands.\ntags:\n  - bigstreamer\n  - abc\n  - hive2script\n  - hive\n  - impala\n  - spark\n  - oozie\n  - parquet\n  - corrupted-parquet\n  - fsck\n  - metadata\n  - partition-refresh\n  - stale-metadata\n  - osix\n  - osix.sip\n  - hdfs\n  - application_failure\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  cluster: abc\n  issue_id: IM1364500\n  table: osix.sip\n  affected_partition:\n    par_dt: \"20201123\"\n    par_hr: \"08\"\n  error:\n    message: File has an invalid version number\n    cause: Corrupt Parquet file\n  nodes:\n    - unosix1.bigdata.abc.gr\n    - sn87.bigdata.abc.gr\n    - un2.bigdata.abc.gr\n  tools:\n    - parquet-tools\n    - hdfs fsck\n    - impala-shell\n    - yarn logs\n    - hive\n    - oozie\n    - spark\n    - kinit\n  corrupt_files:\n    - part-00006-17ead666-d5cb-437e-a849-c08ef825bec4.c000\n  commands_executed:\n    - REFRESH osix.sip PARTITION\n    - parquet-tools meta\n    - hdfs dfs -mv\n---\n# abc - BigStreamer - IM1364500 - abc BigStreamer oozie job hive2script failed / stale metadata\n## Description\nImpala queries finish with error for table osix.sip and partition 20201123\nMessage:\nERROR processing query/statement.

Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n## Pollaploi Flow\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n## Troubleshooting Steps\nGuidance for identifying if a file has been successfully picked up, processed, and loaded.\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n```bash\n$ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n> -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n$ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n### Possible Response to Ticket\nHow to respond to common tickets from clients regarding missing table updates.\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\n```\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\nCode and documentation related to the pollaploi workflow.\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**\n---\ndocument_owner: \"Intra team\"\nsystems_involved:\n  - SNMP Custom Poller\n  - BigStreamer\n  - Impala\n  - Hive\n  - HDFS\n  - MySQL\n  - Spark\n  - Sqoop\nscheduling: \n  - cron\n  - oozie\ndata_sources:\n  - SNMP Poller raw files\n  - MySQL SZXUI_MASTER_ENTRY\n  - Impala nnmnps.* metrics tables\ntarget_tables:\n  - nnmnps.nnmcp_qametrics_hist\n  - nnmnps.cpe_metrics\n  - nnmnps.core_metrics\n  - nnmnps.report_daily_*\n  - nnmnps.report_monthly_*\nscripts_location: \"/shared/abc/nnmnps/bin/\"\nhdfs_paths:\n  - \"/ez/landingzone/nnm_custompoller/raw\"\n  - \"/ez/tmp/cpe/exp\"\nresponsible_users:\n  - intra\n  - custompoller\n  - syzefxis\nmonitored: false\nalerts_handling: \"Manual checks or automated email alerts depending on flow\"\nsummary: >\n  This document describes the end-to-end data pipeline for Syzefxis performance metrics. \n  It includes raw data generation from SNMP Custom Poller, periodic transfer to HDFS, Spark transformations,\n  KPI enrichment flows (via shell & SQL scripts), and final reporting via Impala tables and email exports.\n---\n# Syzefxis Flows\n## Useful Links\n- [Business Documents](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/sizefxis/bigstreamer-sizefxis-devops/-/tree/master/docs)\n- [MoP documents](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/sizefxis/bigstreamer-sizefxis-devops/-/tree/master/MOPs)\n- Users **keePass file**: [abc-devpasswd.kdbx](../../../abc-devpasswd.kdbx)  \n- **Troubleshooting Steps**: Refer to MoPs files in [devops repository](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/sizefxis/bigstreamer-sizefxis-devops/-/blob/master/MOPs/README.md?ref_type=heads) of the project\n## Step 1: Ingest Raw SLA Data from Custom Poller\nThis section explains how raw performance metrics are generated on-prem via SNMP Custom Poller, collected, and uploaded to the HDFS landing zone.\n### Step 1.1: Raw File Creation from SNMP Custom Poller\n#### Creation of raw files\nThe source system in this case is SNMP Custom Poller application.

We notice in the logs that the problem started with timeouts in requests to the etcd of the cluster, which seem to be due to a high Disk I/O of the sdb disk of mncdsw1 at that moment. As a result we have the inability to synchronize the control plane pods with the base of the cluster, which led to their termination and by extension the entire service. Attached you will also find the screenshot that describes the high Disk I/O at that time.\\nContinuing the analysis we noticed that this behavior is periodic, and more specifically it happens every Sunday at 6 am. Attached you will also find the screenshots that show that there was the same problem on January 15, 22 and 29. Before January the logs are clean. Could you tell us if you have any job set up every Sunday morning that needs a lot of Disk I/O?\\n## Action Points\\nWe opened [this](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer/-/issues/25) issue to re-evaluate CDSW disk architecture.",

We did a restrart, just that, and it now appears to be in good health status.\nHowever, we still get the same error.\nIn CDSW status it has the following message:\n```\nFailed to run CDSW Nodes Check. * Failed to run CDSW system pods check. * Failed to run CDSW application pods check. * Failed to run CDSW services check. * Failed to run CDSW secrets check. * Failed to run CDSW persistent volumes check. * Failed to run...\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### 1. Restart CDSW via Cloudera Manager\n1. Restart CDSW\nThe customer had already restarted CDSW, so we tried it once more in order to live monitor it.\n```bash\nCloudera Manager -> CDSW -> Restart\n```\n### 2. Monitor Startup Logs with cdsw status\n2. Check status\nWe followed the logs until CDSW was available again.\n```bash\n#from mncdsw1\ncdsw status\n...\nCloudera Data Science Workbench is ready!\n```\nSince CDSW was up and running, we continued with root cause analysis.\n### 3. Inspect /var/log/cdsw/cdsw_health.log for Errors\n3. Check logs\n```bash\nless /var/log/cdsw/cdsw_health.log\n```\nFirstly, we noticed an abnormal behavior with some of the control plane pods:\n```bash\n2023-01-29 05:50:53,868 ERROR cdsw.status:Pods not ready in cluster kube-system ['component/kube-controller-manager', 'component/kube-scheduler'].\n```\nAnd after that, CDSW lost connection with apiserver pod completely:\n```bash\n2023-01-29 05:51:42,392 WARNING urllib3.connectionpool:Retrying (Retry(total=2, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7f740549bb50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused',)': /api/v1/nodes\n2023-01-29 05:51:42,735 WARNING urllib3.connectionpool:Retrying (Retry(total=1, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7f740549b710>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused',)': /api/v1/nodes\n2023-01-29 05:51:43,065 WARNING urllib3.connectionpool:Retrying (Retry(total=0, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7f740549b050>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused',)': /api/v1/nodes\n2023-01-29 05:51:43,371 ERROR cdsw.status:Failed to run CDSW Nodes Check.\n```\n### 4.

We notice in the logs that the problem started with timeouts in requests to the etcd of the cluster, which seem to be due to a high Disk I/O of the sdb disk of mncdsw1 at that moment. As a result we have the inability to synchronize the control plane pods with the base of the cluster, which led to their termination and by extension the entire service. Attached you will also find the screenshot that describes the high Disk I/O at that time.\nContinuing the analysis we noticed that this behavior is periodic, and more specifically it happens every Sunday at 6 am. Attached you will also find the screenshots that show that there was the same problem on January 15, 22 and 29. Before January the logs are clean. Could you tell us if you have any job set up every Sunday morning that needs a lot of Disk I/O?\n## Action Points\nWe opened [this](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer/-/issues/25) issue to re-evaluate CDSW disk architecture.\n---\ntitle: CDSW Job Failures due to CNI Plugin Network Error (Status 34)\ndescription: Investigation into failed CDSW jobs (e.g., Set_Point_Automation) with engine exit status 34.

Identify Affected Jobs and Confirm Failure via CDSW UI\n1. Connect with you personal ldap account in 'https://mncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr/'\n2. Go to last tab(admin).\n3. Select `Activity` tab.\n4. Inspect the Jobs in question.\nThe jobs are in `FAILED` status. The logs for the failed applications are missing.\n### 2. Investigate Job Pod Failures in Kubernetes\n5. Troubleshoot from the command line:\nFrom `mncdsw1` as root (use personal account and then sudo):\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -w -A # Wait a pod to fail (namespace should be like default-user-XXX)\n# After a while, a pod has failed, describe it\nkubectl describe pod -n default-user-XXX XXXXXXXX\n```\n### 3.

Restore Weave Functionality by Restarting Docker\n7. Restart the docker daemon to restart all containers on `wrkcdsw4`\n_At the time of the issue, CDSW had stale configuration that required full restart (outage) which was not desirable_\nTo avoid applying the settings, restart the service with the same configuration by triggering a restart by `supervisord` deployed as part of the Cloudera agent\n#### Details\n ![Danger ahead](https://media3.giphy.com/media/vvzMdSygQejBIejeRO/200w.gif?cid=6c09b952aacsm9yssw6k6q0z5v8ejuy82rjpvw6qdhglcwpu&rid=200w.gif&ct=g)\nFrom wrkcdsw4 as root (use personal account and then sudo):\n```bash\n/opt/cloudera/cm-agent/bin/supervisorctl -c /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/supervisor/supervisord.conf status | grep DOCKER\n# Sample\n# 145071-cdsw-CDSW_DOCKER          RUNNING   pid 39353, uptime 29 days, 0:40:20\n/opt/cloudera/cm-agent/bin/supervisorctl -c /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/supervisor/supervisord.conf restart 145071-cdsw-CDSW_DOCKER\n```\n### 5.

SSH into **p1node01** and as root create the repository directories:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# mkdir -p /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n```\nDownload the desired RPMs from [Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html), place them inside\n`/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` and create the repository:\n```bash\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo .\n```\nSSH into one of the edge nodes, create the corresponding yum repo file and **scp** it into\nall other edge nodes:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxx@pr1edge01\n$ sudo -i\n# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo\n[oracle_java]\nname = oracle_java\nbaseurl =  http://p1node01.mno.gr/oracle_java\nenabled = 1\ngpgcheck = 0\n# scp /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo XXXedgeXX:/etc/yum.repos.d/\n```\nFinally on each edge node install the above packages:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum install jdk-1.8\n```\n## Step 2: Update the Repository with New RPMs\nDownload the desired version of Oracle Java 8 from\n[Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) or\n[Oracle Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and\nplace the RPMs inside `/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` of **pr1node01**. Login to\n**pr1node01** and update the repository with the new packages:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo --update .\n```\n## Step 3: Upgrade Java on Edge Hosts\n### Preparation\nBefore upgrading the edge nodes, their resources must be moved to other nodes and a backup\nof the old java be made. Login to each edge node:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# cp -rap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64/  /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n### Execution\nInside each edge node, update the java package using **YUM**:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum update java-1.8\n```\nCopy the old certificates into the new installation directory and run the update alternatives\ntool where you input the new version when prompted:\n```bash\n# cp -ap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts \\\n/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<new version>-amd64/jre/lib/security/\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\nIf everything is OK unstandby the node and check each wildfly instance's access and\nserver logs for the following:\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/server.log`: There are no undeployed WARs\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/access.log`: Everything is reporting HTTP 200 status\nDetailed wildfly information and management instructions can be found\n[here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/manage_wildfly.md).\n## Step 4: Rollback to Previous Java Version\nLogin to each edge node and downgrade using the update-alternatives and inputting the previous version:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\n---\ntitle: Kubernetes Certificate Renewal Procedure\ndescription: Yearly renewal process for expiring Kubernetes certificates on kubemaster1, kubemaster2, and kubemaster3 including backup, kubeadm certs renewal, and container restarts.\ntags: [kubernetes, certificates, renewal, kubeadm, kubemaster, static pods, downtime, cluster-admin, tls]\ncategory: infrastructure\nproduct: BigStreamer\nplatform: kubernetes\nconfidentiality: internal\n---\n# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring.

Edit the file /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config and replace the values of client-certificate-data and client-key-data with the ones copied from /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf.\nin order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n```bash\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n```bash\nkubectl get pods\n```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\n1bd22e95ef01        5a84bb672db8           \"kube-scheduler --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-scheduler_kube-scheduler-cti-cx1_kube-system_649aa160f1bd0840b2bb0f70b6493f99_9\ncf43799ae77d0       b6e18ffb844e6          \"kube-apiserver --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                 \n```\nStop containers IDs:\n```bash\nctrctl stop 1350c48cbfb5 1bd22e95ef01 cf3cb7655b99d\n```\n> Ndef_1: Keep in mind that when the containers will be stopped, there will be downtime\n> Ndef_2: Keep in mind that those pods are static so you don't need to kill them. They will be automatically restarted\n- Also delete core-dns pod:\n```bash\nkubectl get pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns\nNAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\ncoredns-64897985d-7dzkl   1/1     Running   3 (84d ago)   644d\ncoredns-64897985d-rw5kc   1/1     Running   0             83d\n```\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-64897985d-7dzkl  coredns-64897985d-rw5kc  -n kube-system\n```\n- Repeat the same procedure for `kubemaster2` and `kubemaster3`\n> Note: The user `incelligent` exists only on kubemaster1.

Ensures certificate integrity before replacement.\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command: \n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n### Check signed certificates from mno\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer, subject, TLS Web, date.\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n- Check the issuer\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n- Check the subject\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this:\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n- Check the TLS Web\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n- Check the dates\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n- Or with a for loop for all the files\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder: `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE ---\n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\nwith the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nwith the certificate from \n`cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \nand copy the section:\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\nand replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`.\nFor example:\n```bash\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has sent to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same. If not, the certificate is wrong\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\nExplains how to safely stop Spark flows and prepare systems for certificate changes.\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n```\n# Signal Spark flows to shut down safely before cert replacement\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application -list | grep -i PROD_\n```\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs -put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\nCheck that flows stopped.\n```",

If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n---\ntitle: RAN.AI Airflow Scheduler Failure Due to Longhorn PVC Issue\ndescription: Investigation and resolution of a pod failure in the RAN.AI Kubernetes namespace caused by stuck Longhorn PVC replicas, leading to `airflow-scheduler` entering CrashLoopBackOff state and failing to mount volumes.

Log events showed repeated errors related to mounting the `logs` volume, with specific references to device formatting failures (e.g., `mke2fs exit status 1`) and timeouts in the Kubernetes event log.\nDespite restarting the pod, it remained in an `Init:0/1` state. Investigations using `kubectl`, Longhorn UI, and `kubemaster` logs revealed that three PVC replicas were stuck in a deleting state, which blocked the volume from attaching correctly. This indicated a storage issue potentially linked to a bug in the Longhorn engine.\nThe airflow scheduler is down due to access rights in the logs folder.\npod airflow-scheduler-0 had entered a restart loop as shown below.\n```bash\nroot@kubemaster1:~# kubectl get pods -n ranai-geo\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nairflow-postgresql-0 1/1 Running 0 326d\nairflow-scheduler-0 0/2

again.\nLogs and events after pod restart are attached.\n```bash\nroot@kubemaster1:~# kubectl get pods -n ranai-geo\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nairflow-postgresql-0 1/1 Running 0

investigate possible underlying storage issues, we accessed [Longhorn](https://kubemaster-vip.bigdata.abc.gr/longhorn/) and discovered that the PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) associated with the airflow-scheduler had three replicas of airflow-scheduler pvc stuck in a deleting state.\n![longhornUI](.media/longhornbug.JPG)\n## Resolution\nTo resolve the issue and restore the airflow-scheduler pod's functionality, the following steps were taken:\n### Deletion of Problematic PVC\nThe three problematic replicas of airflow-scheduler PVC in Longhorn, which were stuck in a deleting state, were the problem, as a result we deleted the airflow's PVC.\nNfgh: It is important to mention that this issue might be related to a bug within the Longhorn storage system, as it caused replicated PVCs to get stuck in a deleting state. Further investigation and monitoring of Longhorn may be necessary to prevent such issues from recurring. Also see this [thread](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4278)\n## Actions Taken\nDeleted problematic PVCs in Longhorn under instance-manager-r namespace.\n`kubectl delete pvc pvc-c826d577-e764-470e-9904-3986042810aa -n ranai-geo`\n## Recommendations\nMonitor Longhorn for any recurring issues with PVC management to prevent similar incidents.\n---\ntitle: How to Change OpenLDAP Manager Password\ndescription: Step-by-step instructions for changing the OpenLDAP Manager password on `kerb1` and ensuring replication with `kerb2` is functional.\nowner: kpar\nsystem: OpenLDAP\ncluster: BigStreamer\nservices:\n  - LDAP\nnodes:\n  - kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr\n  - kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr\ntags:\n  - ldap\n  - password\n  - openldap\n  - kerb\n  - manager\n  - authentication\n  - security\nstatus: verified\nlast_updated: 2024-05-01\nrelated_docs:\n  - KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx\n---\nThis procedure explains how to securely change the OpenLDAP Manager password on kerb1, update both the config and data databases via LDIF files, and verify replication and authentication using both CLI and the phpLDAPadmin web UI.\n# OpenLDAP Manager Password Change\nFor every ldasearch the password of `Manager` is [here](KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n## Step 1: Login to LDAP Node\nLogin into the primary LDAP node (`kerb1`) with root access.\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\n## Step 2: Generate New SSHA Password Hash\nUse `slappasswd` to create a new SSHA-encoded password for the LDAP Manager account.\n```bash\nslappasswd -h {SSHA}\n```\n## Step 3: Store the output \nThe output will be start with something like `{SSHA}xxxxxxx` \n## Step 4: Create LDIF Files to Apply Password Change\nCreate two LDIF files: one for the config database and one for the BDB (data) database.\n### 4a.

Execute steps 1-5 from [this doc](knowledge-base/abc/BigStreamer/20201125-IM1363226.md)\n2. After the check we saw that table `brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist` had no data for 20210119 and 20210120, even though upstream tables were populated.\n```bash\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20210115'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\nResult:\ncount(*)\tpar_dt\t\n...\n2491814\t20210117\t\n2491872\t20210118\t\n2494261\t20210121\t\n...\n```\n3. Check coordinator `coord_brond_load_dsl_daily_stats` that populates this table as explained in [here](systems-info/abc/BigStreamer/Brond/cube_indicators_pipeline.md). \n4. Check that source tables `brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week` and `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week` have data for these partitions. Same query for `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week`\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week\nwhere par_dt >= '20210115'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\nResult:\ncount(*)\tpar_dt\t\n...\n1806006\t20210116\t\n1806256\t20210117\t\n1806306\t20210118\t\n1808049\t20210119\t\n1808918\t20210120\t\n1810234\t20210121\t\n1811401\t20210122\t\n```\nAs source tables have data, we have to execute only the missing inserts for the affected partitions.\n> Since both ADSL and VDSL source tables contained data for `20210119` and `20210120`, the issue is isolated to the execution of the DSL stats coordinator.\n5. Impala insert queries are under `/user/intra/brond_dsl_stats/impala-shell/populate*.sql`. Change conditions `..par_dt > '20210127..` to get the dates that are missing. In this case `20210119`. Execute the queries using Hue or impala-shell.\n6. Repeat step 2 to validate that data are loaded correctly for missing dates.\n7.

Both Namenodes entered standby mode simultaneously which caused bad health on HDFS,HBASE,OOZIE,IMPALA. After nn1 restarted nn2 became the Active and nn1 the Standby namenode. All the other services was stable after this manual action except HBASE which restarted.\n> The dual-standby state of both Namenodes caused a loss of HDFS coordination, which cascaded failures to other dependent services like HBase, Oozie, and Impala. After restarting nn1, high availability was restored with nn2 becoming active.\n3.

The crash was caused by an `OutOfMemoryError`, due to the default Java heap size being set too low (512MB).\nThe following health issue has occurred in the cloudera manager system:\n```\nSpark on yarn - History Server (dr1node03) - Unexpected Exits\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for DR Site\n2. We inspected logs for this role for the time that the problem arose: `Cloudera > Diagnostics > Logs` and chose `Service: Spark on Yarn` and `Role: History Server`. We could not identify the root cause by these logs\n3. ssh to dr1node03 as root, went to `/var/run/process` , and inspected logs from the process that ran at the time of the problem and found out that the process with pid 51291 was killed while a `OutOfMemoryError` occured\n![terminal_screenshot](.media/IM2098517/spark_on_yarn.png)\n### Resolution\n4. We checked the  `java heap size` of the History Server through Cloudera UI configuration tab. It was set to 512M.\n5. We checked the respective option for the PR Site and it was set to 2G\n6. We set the `java heap size` of the History Server to 2G at the DR Site\n7. We proceeded to restart of the role after communication with the customer\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n07/03/23 16:28:55 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nWe have restarted the History Server after a phone call. There was no problem during the restart.\nThank you\n07/03/23 16:21:21 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe exit occurred due to an out of memory error. We have changed the java heap size of the History Server from 512MB to 2GB as in the PR. We will need to restart the role. There will be no outage.\n```\n---\ntitle: Oracle Java 1.8 Minor Upgrade on Edge Nodes\ndescription: Procedure for upgrading Oracle Java 1.8 to a newer minor version on BigStreamer edge nodes, including local RPM repository setup, edge node preparation, execution, certificate handling, update-alternatives configuration, and rollback instructions.\ntags:\n  - java\n  - oracle-java\n  - upgrade\n  - edge-nodes\n  - yum\n  - rpm\n  - certificates\n  - update-alternatives\n  - rollback\n  - cloudera\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  systems:\n    - pr1edge01\n    - pr1edge02\n    - dr1edge01\n    - dr1edge02\n    - pr1node01\n  tools:\n    - Oracle Java 8\n    - YUM\n    - update-alternatives\n    - Wildfly\n    - jssecacerts\n  repositories:\n    - /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n---\n# Oracle Java 1.8 Upgrade Procedure on Edge Nodes\nThis document describes the controlled upgrade of Oracle Java 1.8 minor versions on BigStreamer edge nodes. It covers the creation and maintenance of a local RPM repository on pr1node01, edge node backup and update procedures, handling of security certificates, switching Java versions using update-alternatives, and guidance for validating application behavior post-upgrade. Rollback steps are also provided.\nThis document outlines the upgrade process of minor java version for Oracle Java 1.8\non mno's edge nodes. All procedures pertain to PR and DR edge nodes, except the RPM repository\ncreation which is performed on pr1node1:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n## Step 1: Create Local RPM Repository\nThis step only needs to be performed once as all subsequent RPM's will be placed inside this\nrepository. SSH into **p1node01** and as root create the repository directories:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# mkdir -p /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n```\nDownload the desired RPMs from [Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html), place them inside\n`/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` and create the repository:\n```bash\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo .\n```\nSSH into one of the edge nodes, create the corresponding yum repo file and **scp** it into\nall other edge nodes:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxx@pr1edge01\n$ sudo -i\n# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo\n[oracle_java]\nname = oracle_java\nbaseurl =  http://p1node01.mno.gr/oracle_java\nenabled = 1\ngpgcheck = 0\n# scp /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo XXXedgeXX:/etc/yum.repos.d/\n```\nFinally on each edge node install the above packages:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum install jdk-1.8\n```\n## Step 2: Update the Repository with New RPMs\nDownload the desired version of Oracle Java 8 from\n[Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) or\n[Oracle Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and\nplace the RPMs inside `/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` of **pr1node01**. Login to\n**pr1node01** and update the repository with the new packages:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo --update .\n```\n## Step 3: Upgrade Java on Edge Hosts\n### Preparation\nBefore upgrading the edge nodes, their resources must be moved to other nodes and a backup\nof the old java be made. Login to each edge node:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# cp -rap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64/  /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n### Execution\nInside each edge node, update the java package using **YUM**:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum update java-1.8\n```\nCopy the old certificates into the new installation directory and run the update alternatives\ntool where you input the new version when prompted:\n```bash\n# cp -ap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts \\\n/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<new version>-amd64/jre/lib/security/\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\nIf everything is OK unstandby the node and check each wildfly instance's access and\nserver logs for the following:\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/server.log`: There are no undeployed WARs\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/access.log`: Everything is reporting HTTP 200 status\nDetailed wildfly information and management instructions can be found\n[here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/manage_wildfly.md).\n## Step 4: Rollback to Previous Java Version\nLogin to each edge node and downgrade using the update-alternatives and inputting the previous version:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\n---\ntitle: HiveServer2 OutOfMemory Crash on dr1node04 Due to Large Queries on pmnt_response_stg_0\ndescription: HiveServer2 on dr1node04 crashed with OutOfMemory errors after executing multiple large queries on dev_trlog_card.pmnt_response_stg_0; identified via JVM heap/GC logs and Cloudera monitoring charts, then resolved by service restart.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - hiveserver2\n  - dr1node04\n  - outofmemory\n  - java heap space\n  - garbage collector\n  - pause duration\n  - cloudera manager\n  - jvm heap\n  - gc logs\n  - dev_trlog_card\n  - pmnt_response_stg_0\n  - query failure\n  - yarn\n  - application timeout\n  - hive crash\n  - im2024442\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2024442\n  system: mno BigStreamer DR1 HiveServer2\n  root_cause: Multiple concurrent heavy queries caused Java heap saturation in HiveServer2, leading to long GC pauses and service crash\n  resolution_summary: HiveServer2 on dr1node04 was restarted and returned to normal operation; queries from E30825 and E36254 on pmnt_response_stg_0 table identified as root cause\n  affected_component: HiveServer2\n  crashing_queries:\n    - application_1665578283516_50081\n    - application_1665578283516_50084\n    - application_1665578283516_50085\n    - application_1665578283516_50088\n    - application_1665578283516_50089\n    - application_1665578283516_50090\n    - application_1665578283516_50095\n    - application_1665578283516_50096\n  affected_table: dev_trlog_card.pmnt_response_stg_0\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2024442 - Critical alarm in Cloudera Application - dr1edge01\n## Description\nA critical alarm appeared in Cloudera Application in dr1edge01.\nHive --> HiveServer2 (dr1node04) // Pause Duration.\n## Actions Taken\n1.

Restart HiveServer2 Instance if needed (workaround).\n``` bash\nIn our case the service had Unexpected Exits due to OutOfMemory. \n```\n3. Search for \"Java Heap Space\" failed Jobs in HiveServer2 Service Logs.\n```bash\ngrep Java /var/log/hive/hadoop-cmf-hive-HIVESERVER2-dr1node 04.mno-gr.log.out\n```\nExample Output:\n![hiveServer2Logs.PNG](.media/hiveServer2Logs.PNG)\n4. Check failed Yarn Applications from Cloudera Manager that match those of the previous step.\n```bash\nCluster -> Yarn -> Applications -> Filter: \"application_type = MAPREDUCE\"\n```\n5. Search for GC Pause Duration in HiveServer2 Service Logs and make sure that the warnings started after the submission of the failed jobs.\n```bash\ngrep GC /var/log/hive/hadoop-cmf-hive-HIVESERVER2-dr1node 04.mno-gr.log.out\n```\n6. Compare the timestamps of all the above to be sure that you have found the queries that caused the problem.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\nHiveServer2 of dr1node04 is back up. Services and flows have been checked and there is no problem at this time.\n```\n```\nThe following findings emerged from the analysis:\nHiveServer2 of dr1node04 crashed from OutOfMemory, because the Java Heap Space was full.\nThe Pause Duration messages in Cloudera Manager are related to the Garbage Collector delay.",

Login to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `mtuser` with sudo\n2. Inspect logs of *CSI fix* flow. Nfgh that filename format is `CSI_fix_<mmddyyyy>_w<week>.txt` and that there is a 2 day delay between the export time and the exported data. In this case there was a problem with the file containing data for 2020-11-22 which was exported at 2020-11-24. So we checked the logs for 2020-11-24. \n```bash\ncd /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log\nless sai_csi.cron.20201124.log\n```\n3. Check if the source table contained data for the export date.\nIn `sai_csi.cron.20201124.log`:\n``` bash\nQuery: use `sai`\nQuery: select nvl ... from sai.cube_indicators_it where par_dt='20201122'\n...\nFetched 0 row(s) in 0.06s\nProblem with 20201122.\n```\n4. Check if the source table contains data for this date. Please nfgh that the source table is just a view of table `brond.cube_indicators`.\n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2458393,20201123\n```\n5. Identify Missing Data in brond.cube_indicators. Since 3 dates are missing 2020/11/20-22, we need to run the workflow that populates `brond.cube_indicators`. But first we have to make sure all its table dependecies are loaded. Execute the following queries in an impala-shell or an Impala editor in Hue and make sure not only that partitions exist for those dates but also that there are an identical amount of lines.\n```sql\nselect count(*), par_dt\nfrom brond.brond_retrains_hist\nwhere par_dt >= '20201118'\ngroup by 2\norder by 2;\n...\ncount(*),par_dt\n2499833,20201118\n2497948,20201119\n*2496522,20201120*\n*2497810,20201121*\n*2497480,20201122*\n2496932,20201123\n2497130,20201124\n2505791,20201125\n``` \nExecute the same query for tables:\n- brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp\n- brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq\n- radius.radacct_hist\n- brond.brond_retrains_hist\n- brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist\nThis confirms the root cause: the brond.cube_indicators table lacked data for these dates, resulting in empty CSI_fix exports.\n6. Rerun Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators for Missing Partitions. Run Cube_Indicators workflow. Login to Hue as intra and navigate to Workflows > Dashboards > Coordinators. Search for `Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators` and click on the coordinator to view its executions. Select **one** at a time of the executions that need to be repeated. Nfgh that `brond.cube_indicators` is populated with a 2 day delay so if we want to load data for 2020-11-20 we have to execute the workflow of 2020-11-22. Select the execution from the check box and click `Rerun`. \n7. After each workflow execution repeat the query of step 4 to verify that table has been loaded. \n``` bash\nimpala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query=\"select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;\";\n...\ncount(*),par_date\n2454925,20201118\n2453089,20201119\n2454321,20201120\n2458393,20201123\n```\n8. Gather dates that need to be exported. As we saw in step 5 the source table was empty for 3 partitions: 20201120, 20201121, 20201122. The files produced for them was empty. Verify by checking `/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log`:\n```bash\n2020-11-21 09:01:39  CSI_fix_11212020_w47.txt  20201119  2453089\n2020-11-22 09:00:43  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  0\n2020-11-23 09:28:14  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  0\n2020-11-24 09:01:01  CSI_fix_11242020_w47.txt  20201122  0\n2020-11-25 09:03:13  CSI_fix_11252020_w48.txt  20201123  2458393\n```\n*CSI fix* provides a mechanism to avoid manual re-export of empty files. The most recent date of an empty file is stored in a table and automatically exported with the next execution. To view the date stored issue the query:\n```bash\nselect * from refdata.mediation_csi_load_info;\n...\nload_time,flow_name\nNULL,sai.mob\n20201122,sai.fix\n```\nSo we don't need to export manually date 20201122, only dates 20201120 & 20201121.\n9. Manually Export CSI_fix Files Using export_csi_fix.sh. Finally, to export the files we have to repeat step 1 and execute the export script **sequentially** for the desired dates + 2 days:\n```bash\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201122 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201123 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &\n```\nThis confirms the missing CSI_fix files were regenerated successfully with the expected number of lines.\n10. Afterwards check the reconciliation log file that files have been exported:\n```bash\nless /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log\n...\n2020-11-25 10:46:40  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  4915294\n2020-11-25 10:51:17  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  2457858\n```\nThe first one contains more lines as it includes dates 20201120 & 20201122.\n## Affected Systems\nabc Bigstreamer Backend\n---\ntitle: brond.an_rollout_data_hist - Data Not Loaded After 20210924\ndescription: Step-by-step analysis and resolution of missing data in `brond.an_rollout_data_hist` after 20210924, including error diagnosis in logs, root cause identification due to ambiguous field reference post-upgrade, script patching, and manual reload of missed partitions using `000_brond_rollout_post.sh`.\ntags:\n  - bigstreamer\n  - brond\n  - rollout\n  - an_rollout_data_hist\n  - missing partitions\n  - manual reload\n  - field ambiguity\n  - script fix\n  - data pipeline\n  - cronjob\n  - data load failure\n  - hql\n  - impala\n  - yarn\n  - upgrade regression\n  - abc\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: SD1716699\n  system: abc BigStreamer Brond rollout ingestion\n  detection_target: partition gap in `brond.an_rollout_data_hist`\n  failed_partitions: [\"20210925\", \"20210926\", \"20211003\", \"20211004\", \"20211005\", \"20211006\"]\n  script_path: /shared/abc/brond/bin/000_brond_rollout_post.sh\n  log_path: /shared/abc/brond/log/brond_rollout_cron.YYYYMMDD.log\n  root_cause: field alias ambiguity in post-upgrade Impala SQL\n  fix: rename colid to colid1 in subquery alias in join\n  reload_command: /shared/abc/brond/bin/000_brond_rollout_post.sh <YYYYMMDD>\n---\n# abc - SD1716699 ( brond.an_rollout_data_hist ) \n## Description\nThis document describes the resolution of missing data in the `brond.an_rollout_data_hist` table after 24/09, because it stopped loading data due to a post-upgrade SQL ambiguity error in a shell script.

It also includes detailed troubleshooting steps for resolving SPN-related Kerberos preauthentication errors and replication failures across KDCs.\n# Manage IDM Replication\n## Setup\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been installed on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n### Force replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n## Troubleshooting\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n### A brief history of preauthentication\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### Troubleshooting Preauthentication Issues\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n```bash\nipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n```\n```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n```\n```bash\nipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n```\n```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n```\n`krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n```\n```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes: REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH\n    Policy: [none]\n```\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n```\n```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes:\n    Policy: [none]\n```\nSeems that preauthentication is enforced via `krbTicketFlags`. We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n```\nNow replication works.\n### Re-enable SPN Preauthentication (Post-Migration Cleanup)\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\n---\ntitle: \"GROUPNET - Change Bind Users' Passwords\"\ndescription: \"Step-by-step guide for updating LDAP bind user passwords for RAN.AI Geolocation and R-Studio Connect services in the GROUPNET domain, including license reactivation if needed.\"\ntags:\n  - ldap\n  - bind user\n  - password rotation\n  - rstudio connect\n  - ran.ai\n  - groupnet\n  - license activation\n  - cyberark\n  - keycloak\n  - ldap integration\n  - rstudio-connect.gcfg\n  - authentication\n---\n# GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords\nThis document outlines the procedure for rotating LDAP bind user passwords for the GROUPNET domain, covering both RAN.AI Geolocation (`t1-svc-cneranaibind`) and R-Studio Connect (`t1-svc-cnebind`).

This morning we reset the user's password because it had expired. It can connect normally with the credentials. Also let me know that the applications of the other users (Charisis, Ploskas) are running normally.\n## Actions Taken\n### 1. Validate LDAP Bind Account (t1-svc-cnebind)\n- Ssh to **unrstudio1**\n- Do an ldap search using `t1-svc-cnebind` as the following in order to check if `t1-svc-cnebind` password is still valid:\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=t1-svc-cnebind)'\n```\n-  In the above case, if you get an error that you can't connect with the ldap server, that means it has an expired `t1-svc-cnebind` password, so you will need to replace it with a new one.\n### 2. Update LDAP Bind Password in RStudio Connect Config\n- Check the configuration file below for the current ldap t1-svc-cnebind password & replace it with new **(Responsible for that abc Admin)**:\n```bash\nssh unrstudio1\nvi /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg\n```\n### Conclusion\nRStudio Connect applications for user `kmpoletis` failed due to expired `t1-svc-cnebind` LDAP credentials. Issue resolved by updating the bind password in the system configuration file.

LDIF for config database\n```bash\nvi changepwconfig.ldif\ndn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: olcRootPW\nolcRootPW: paste the output from step `3`\n```\n### 4b. LDIF for manager database\n```bash\nvi changepwmanager.ldif\ndn: olcDatabase={2}bdb,cn=config\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: olcRootPW\nolcRootPW: paste the output from step `3`\n```\n## Step 5: Backup Existing Configuration\nUse `slapcat` to export the current config and data for recovery purposes.\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif\nslapcat -n 2 -l data.ldif\n```\n## Step 6: Apply Password Changes\nUse `ldapmodify` with the generated LDIF files to apply the password change.\n```bash\nldapmodify -H ldapi:// -Y EXTERNAL -f changepwmanager.ldif\nldapmodify -H ldapi:// -Y EXTERNAL -f changepwconfig.ldif\n```\n## Step 7: Validate the New Password\nTest that the new Manager password works both via CLI and web UI on `kerb1` and `kerb2`.\n### 7a. Command-Line Verification\nFor `kerb1`. Where `uid` add a ldap user. e.g your ldap username:\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=xxxx'\n```\nFor `kerb2`. Where `uid` add a ldap user. e.g your ldap username::\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=xxxx'\n```\n### 7b. Web UI Verification\nLogin into `admin` node as `root`:\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/\nTry to connect with the new `Manager` password\n---\ntitle: RStudio Connect - Migrate to GROUPNET Domain\ndescription: Procedure for migrating RStudio Connect LDAP authentication from central-domain.root.def.gr to GROUPNET domain including certificate verification, configuration changes, user license management, and resolving duplicate users.\ntags:\n  - rstudio-connect\n  - ldap\n  - groupnet\n  - user-migration\n  - license-management\n  - project-transfer\n  - domain-migration\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  environment: BigStreamer\n  system: unrstudio1\n  domain_from: central-domain.root.def.gr\n  domain_to: groupnet\n  login_page: https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n---\n# RStudio - Change Domain Procedure\n## Description\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\n### Server\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n### Useful info\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n### Prerequisites\nVerify if GROUPNET LDAP SSL certificates are already trusted by the server\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n### Backup\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n### Update configuration\nUpdate RStudio Connect config file with new LDAP bind credentials and search base DNs\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n3. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n### Rstudio Lisence\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n### Delete user\nClean up a deactivated or duplicate user from RStudio Connect user base\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\nOutput must be something like below:\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no output.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\nTransfer user ownership and projects from central-domain to GROUPNET in case of duplicated accounts\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- Chrisostomos Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- Chrisostomos Charisis, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n---\ntitle: \"Fixing OpenLDAP Replication Issues\"\ndescription: \"Step-by-step instructions for resolving OpenLDAP replication failures between kerb1 and kerb2, including password updates, slapcat/slapadd procedures, and verification via ldapsearch.\"\ntags:\n  - openldap\n  - replication\n  - ldap\n  - slapcat\n  - slapadd\n  - kerb1\n  - kerb2\n  - phpldapadmin\n  - ldapsearch\n  - slapd\n  - sync\n  - mirror mode\n  - user creation\n  - credentials\n  - config.ldif\n  - data.ldif\n  - restore ldap\n  - slapd.d\n---\n# How to fix openldap replication\nThis guide documents how to fix broken OpenLDAP replication between kerb1 and kerb2, addressing two scenarios: a Manager password change or corruption due to events like power outages.

We noticed that since yesterday morning, alerts have stopped coming from the cloudera manager.\nA test mail was sent today from the cloudera manager which came normally but the automatic mails we receive every day have stopped.\n## Actions Taken\n### 1. Log Inspection on un5 Node\n- Ssh to **un5**  Alert Publisher Node and check the following files for error:\n```\nless /var/log/messages\nless /var/log/mail.err \nless /var/log/mail.info \nless /var/log/cloudera-scm-alertpublisher\nless mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out\n```\n### 2. Historical Alert Frequency Analysis\n- Use the following commands as example to check the above log file in order to count how many alerts are in the logs and you can grep depending on month,date and the message. \n```bash\nfor i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Generated subject [Cloudera Alert]' | wc -l;done\nfor i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done\nfor i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done\nfor i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'has become bad' | wc -l;done\nfor i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done\nfor i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done\nfor i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'has become bad' | wc -l;done\nfor i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done\nfor i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done\n```\n### 3. Preventive Restart\n- _Preventively step_ Restart Alert Publisher through Cloudera Manager\n### Conclusion\nAlertPublisher was functioning normally. The temporary absence of automated email alerts was due to a drop in alert volume during a national vacation period. No system misconfiguration or failure was detected.\nFrom the above investigation we came up to the result that no issues were found with the email alerting system; the absence of alerts was due to reduced system activity during the vacation period.\n---\ntitle: IPVPN-SM Replacement ETL & App  \ndescription: Spring Boot-based application and ETL scripts that extract KPIs from BigStreamer and export them to the SQM server every 5 minutes.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\nStep-by-step description of how the ETL pipeline is executed using scripts and Spring Boot app.\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n### IPVPN-SM Endpoint: /ingest-query\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`.

It also includes detailed troubleshooting steps for resolving SPN-related Kerberos preauthentication errors and replication failures across KDCs.\\n# Manage IDM Replication\\n## Setup\\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been installed on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \\\"push\\\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\\n```mermaid\\n  graph LR\\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\\n  A-->B\\n  B-->A\\n```\\n## Procedure\\n### Check replication\\n``` bash\\n# Assuming you are on idm1\\nkinit <admin user>\\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\\n```\\n```log\\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\\n```\\n### Force replication\\n``` bash\\n# Assuming you are on idm1\\nkinit <admin user>\\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\\n```\\n```log\\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\\\=bigdata\\\\,dc\\\\=abc\\\\,dc\\\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\\\=bigdata\\\\,dc\\\\=abc\\\\,dc\\\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\\n```\\n## Troubleshooting\\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \\n### A brief history of preauthentication\\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\\n### Troubleshooting Preauthentication Issues\\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\\n```bash\\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\\\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\\\"\\n```\\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`.

It also includes detailed troubleshooting steps for resolving SPN-related Kerberos preauthentication errors and replication failures across KDCs.\n# Manage IDM Replication\n## Setup\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been installed on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n### Force replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n## Troubleshooting\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n### A brief history of preauthentication\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n### Troubleshooting Preauthentication Issues\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic. Usually only one site is active (Primary Site).\\n```mermaid\\n  graph TD\\n  A[Internet Banking Backend Servers] -->|HTTP Requests| B[Load Balancer - Netscaler]\\n  B -->|Active| C[pr1edge01.mno.gr]\\n  B -->|Active| D[pr1edge02.mno.gr]\\n  B -.->|Stopped| E[dr1edge01.mno.gr]\\n  B -.->|Stopped| F[dr1edge02.mno.gr]\\n  C -->|Kafka Producer| G[Primary Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\\n  D -->|Kafka Producer| G\\n  E -.->|Stopped| H[Disaster Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\\n  F -.->|Stopped| H\\n```\\n**User**: `PRODREST`\\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_wildfly.md)\\n**Instructions for migrating traffic to DR site**: [Here](../procedures/failover.md)\\n**Alerts**:\\n- [PR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\\n- [DR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\\n- [PR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\\n- [DR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\\n- Check application logs for error messages.\\n- In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\\n- If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Kafka performance.\\n### Kafka Topic Mirroring via MirrorMaker\\nDescribes the Kafka MirrorMaker setup that replicates `-mir` topics from the active site to final shared topics used by both clusters.\\nAfter being published to Kafka, the traffic is mirrored to the opposite site via Kafka MirrorMaker. In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\\n#### PR replication\\n```mermaid\\n  graph TD\\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\\n\\n```\\n#### DR replication\\n``` mermaid\\n  graph TD\\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\\n```\\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\\n**Alerts**:\\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\\n### Spark Streaming Pipelines\\nSpark topologies consume Kafka events and write them to Kudu and HBase, separating full stream and visible-only transactions.\\nAfter being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream\\nThis topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic. Usually only one site is active (Primary Site).\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Internet Banking Backend Servers] -->|HTTP Requests| B[Load Balancer - Netscaler]\n  B -->|Active| C[pr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -->|Active| D[pr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| E[dr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| F[dr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  C -->|Kafka Producer| G[Primary Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  D -->|Kafka Producer| G\n  E -.->|Stopped| H[Disaster Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  F -.->|Stopped| H\n```\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_wildfly.md)\n**Instructions for migrating traffic to DR site**: [Here](../procedures/failover.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- [PR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [DR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [PR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n- [DR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check application logs for error messages.\n- In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\n- If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Kafka performance.\n### Kafka Topic Mirroring via MirrorMaker\nDescribes the Kafka MirrorMaker setup that replicates `-mir` topics from the active site to final shared topics used by both clusters.\nAfter being published to Kafka, the traffic is mirrored to the opposite site via Kafka MirrorMaker. In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n#### PR replication\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n\n```\n#### DR replication\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n```\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n### Spark Streaming Pipelines\nSpark topologies consume Kafka events and write them to Kudu and HBase, separating full stream and visible-only transactions.\nAfter being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream\nThis topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.

The crash was caused by an `OutOfMemoryError`, due to the default Java heap size being set too low (512MB).\nThe following health issue has occurred in the cloudera manager system:\n```\nSpark on yarn - History Server (dr1node03) - Unexpected Exits\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for DR Site\n2. We inspected logs for this role for the time that the problem arose: `Cloudera > Diagnostics > Logs` and chose `Service: Spark on Yarn` and `Role: History Server`. We could not identify the root cause by these logs\n3. ssh to dr1node03 as root, went to `/var/run/process` , and inspected logs from the process that ran at the time of the problem and found out that the process with pid 51291 was killed while a `OutOfMemoryError` occured\n![terminal_screenshot](.media/IM2098517/spark_on_yarn.png)\n### Resolution\n4. We checked the  `java heap size` of the History Server through Cloudera UI configuration tab. It was set to 512M.\n5. We checked the respective option for the PR Site and it was set to 2G\n6. We set the `java heap size` of the History Server to 2G at the DR Site\n7. We proceeded to restart of the role after communication with the customer\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n07/03/23 16:28:55 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nWe have restarted the History Server after a phone call. There was no problem during the restart.\nThank you\n07/03/23 16:21:21 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe exit occurred due to an out of memory error. We have changed the java heap size of the History Server from 512MB to 2GB as in the PR. We will need to restart the role. There will be no outage.\n```\n---\ntitle: Spark Waiting Batches Alert Due to Resource Contention on MySQL Node (dr1node03)\ndescription: Spark Waiting Batches alerts appeared due to physical user jobs monopolizing resources on dr1node03, where MySQL service is hosted, causing permission denied errors; recommendation was made to disable Impala and YARN roles on this node to prevent contention.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - spark\n  - spark waiting batches\n  - impala\n  - yarn\n  - mysql\n  - resource contention\n  - dr1node03\n  - impala daemon\n  - node manager\n  - grafana\n  - alert\n  - performance tuning\n  - cluster optimization\n  - disaster site\n  - im2099957\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2099957\n  system: mno BigStreamer DR Site\n  root_cause: User-initiated jobs on dr1node03 consumed system resources, affecting MySQL and delaying Spark jobs\n  resolution_summary: No action taken directly; recommendation made to disable Impala Daemon and YARN NodeManager on dr1node03 to avoid future contention\n  affected_node: dr1node03\n  recommendation_links:\n    - https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/66\n    - https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/196\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2099957 - Alert on Grafana\n## Description\nA `[DR][IBANK] Spark Waiting Batches Alert` was triggered in Grafana due to prolonged Spark job delays. The issue stems from physical user workloads (queries, jobs) monopolizing critical system resources\u2014specifically on `dr1node03` where MySQL is hosted. This results in Spark topologies entering a stalled state due to delayed authorization responses from the overloaded MySQL service.\nThe following alert appeared in the grafana system:\n```\n[DR][IBANK] Spark Waiting Batches Alert\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. The following text has been sent to mno/PM and explains the problem, as well as the recommended actions:\n```text\nSpark Waiting Batches Problem: The first and most important problem we have is the \"Spark Waiting Batches\" which opens a ticket for this monitoring. This is due to physical user actions (queries/jobs) that occupy/bind production resources on the disaster site mainly. This results in there being no resources available for the MySQL process (a central point that the entire cluster has a dependency on), the service that does the authorization is unable to process its data in the database and thus causes a delay in the spark topologies until the \"permission denied\" error is resolved. The spark topologies, while up and running, are unable to process the data, as a result of which they continue to execute after the execution of the jobs that occupied the resources on the server where the MySQL service is located has finished. We do not take any action in this nor can we do anything and mno has asked us to close the ticket directly.\nSuggestion: Disable Impala Daemon and YARN Node Manager on dr1node03.mno.gr, pr1node03.mno.gr where the primary MySQL service is located. This will not affect our cluster workload as, as you will see in the attached screenshots:\n1. impala_mean.png: The average memory occupied by Impala Daemon is much smaller than the limit (150GB) that we have set even in the evening hours when all the flows \"close\" the previous day and the largest load is concentrated on the cluster.\n```\n![impala mean usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_mean.PNG)\n``` text\n2. impala_total.png: The total memory commitment from Impala cumulatively for all nodes is at its peak about 500GB less than the total available, which means that by removing a node there will still be room for resources even with the addition of new flows\n```\n![impala total usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_total.PNG)\n```\n3. yarn.png: throughout the day, the available yarn resources are sufficient even with the removal of more than one node\nThe above applies to both sites and the screenshots are from the Disaster site, where the most resources are reserved compared to the 2 sites. It is important as in this MySQL has a dependency on the entire cluster.\n```\n![yarn usage](.media/IM2099957/yarn.PNG)\n``` text\nBy monitoring the remaining nodes of the 2 clusters, we see how they can manage the workload at CPU levels and with the above proposal we will reduce the CPU levels on critical node03 which anyway uses increased CPU for cluster management processes.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nmno Disaster Site\n## Action Points\n- [Issue 66 \u2013 Resource contention on MySQL node (Disable roles)](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/66)  \n- [Issue 196 \u2013 Cluster role optimization for Spark performance](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/196)\n---\ntitle: HiveServer2 OutOfMemory Crash on dr1node04 Due to Large Queries on pmnt_response_stg_0\ndescription: HiveServer2 on dr1node04 crashed with OutOfMemory errors after executing multiple large queries on dev_trlog_card.pmnt_response_stg_0; identified via JVM heap/GC logs and Cloudera monitoring charts, then resolved by service restart.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - hiveserver2\n  - dr1node04\n  - outofmemory\n  - java heap space\n  - garbage collector\n  - pause duration\n  - cloudera manager\n  - jvm heap\n  - gc logs\n  - dev_trlog_card\n  - pmnt_response_stg_0\n  - query failure\n  - yarn\n  - application timeout\n  - hive crash\n  - im2024442\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2024442\n  system: mno BigStreamer DR1 HiveServer2\n  root_cause: Multiple concurrent heavy queries caused Java heap saturation in HiveServer2, leading to long GC pauses and service crash\n  resolution_summary: HiveServer2 on dr1node04 was restarted and returned to normal operation; queries from E30825 and E36254 on pmnt_response_stg_0 table identified as root cause\n  affected_component: HiveServer2\n  crashing_queries:\n    - application_1665578283516_50081\n    - application_1665578283516_50084\n    - application_1665578283516_50085\n    - application_1665578283516_50088\n    - application_1665578283516_50089\n    - application_1665578283516_50090\n    - application_1665578283516_50095\n    - application_1665578283516_50096\n  affected_table: dev_trlog_card.pmnt_response_stg_0\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2024442 - Critical alarm in Cloudera Application - dr1edge01\n## Description\nA critical alarm appeared in Cloudera Application in dr1edge01.\nHive --> HiveServer2 (dr1node04) // Pause Duration.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Check HiveServer2 JVM Heap Memory Usage and JVM Pause Time Charts from Cloudera Manager.\n```bash\ncluster -> Hive -> HiveServer2 -> Charts\n```\n2. Restart HiveServer2 Instance if needed (workaround).\n``` bash\nIn our case the service had Unexpected Exits due to OutOfMemory. \n```\n3.

Check failed Yarn Applications from Cloudera Manager that match those of the previous step.\n```bash\nCluster -> Yarn -> Applications -> Filter: \"application_type = MAPREDUCE\"\n```\n5. Search for GC Pause Duration in HiveServer2 Service Logs and make sure that the warnings started after the submission of the failed jobs.\n```bash\ngrep GC /var/log/hive/hadoop-cmf-hive-HIVESERVER2-dr1node 04.mno-gr.log.out\n```\n6. Compare the timestamps of all the above to be sure that you have found the queries that caused the problem.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\nHiveServer2 of dr1node04 is back up. Services and flows have been checked and there is no problem at this time.\n```\n```\nThe following findings emerged from the analysis:\nHiveServer2 of dr1node04 crashed from OutOfMemory, because the Java Heap Space was full.\nThe Pause Duration messages in Cloudera Manager are related to the Garbage Collector delay.\nSpecifically, from the analysis of the logs we saw that between 14:19 and 15:24, HiveServer2 of dr1node04 was called to manage 8 Queries which crashed with a Java Heap Space error. The GC started throwing warnings from 15:08, as it could not clean the memory of the above.

The problem is described below.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG.

From `Cloudera Manager>Impala>Queries` we searched for queries that took place at the time the problem raised. We found that the query with ID 6d44d9525a681fb8:5e536ffc00000000 had Threads:CPU Time 10.7h. Upon inspection through `Query Details` we saw that the query was of high complexity with conversions and comparisons with regex.\n![Query](.media/query.PNG)\n5. Through Cloudera logs, we noticed that the query impacted the services in the form of timeouts for Kudu and Hive due to slow communication with Sentry Service.\n![hive_problem](.media/SD1949713/hive_problem.PNG)\n![timeouts_kudu](.media/SD1949713/timeouts_kudu.PNG)\n![sentry_problem](.media/SD1949713/sentry_problem.PNG)\n6.

After investigating the logs of the executor using internal firefox and the logs of the DWH_Ibank_MAN_DATE script we saw the following:\n`Cannot insert duplicate key in object srcib.MandateDetails. The duplicate key value is (e5435435-4354254235-121nfdgd33)`\nThat means that the table already has records in it, so we have to drop this records or invoke the script with the `-f` option that gives the ability to truncate the table and then insert the records. \n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t manDate -f\n```\nAfter executing the extract script, we use the same `-f` to run the export script. The reason that we are running export is because in the above mentioned step we run the extract and trancated the table so the export is neccessary. \n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_export_details.sh -t manDate -f\n```\nThe issue has been resolved by executing the above two commands.

Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account and confirm that Datawarehouse Flows have failed from `Monitoring/Monitoring PR/DR` dashboard.\n2. All flows have failed with `Code: 6` which means that the control script has timed-out while monitoring the `EXTRACT` script. The `EXTRACT` step has 2 sub-steps: `Impala Insert` and `Sqoop Export`.\n3. Check logs:\nFrom `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:\n``` bash\nless /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log\n```\nIn this file for all flows that failed we see that the last log entry is the submission of the `Impala Insert` part of the `EXTRACT`, which was still running. This means that another query is hogging all resources for Impala and our flows are waiting to be executed.\n4. Login to Disaster Site Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.mno.gr:7183` and check for resource intensive Impala queries `Clusters > Impala > Queries`. The key resource here is memory as this is the only metric that can be defined in Resource Pools.\nThe query that created the problem was `COMPUTE STATS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`. Pictures are not included because Impala does not report statistics for the `COMPUTE STATS` queries, but given the size of the table and the time of execution it matched. This hypothesis was later confirmed when the same problem appeared on a later `COMPUTE STATS` execution.\n5. We informed the customer to re-run the failed jobs and proposed to stop computing statistics for that table as they did not impact our application.\n``` text\n27/10/22 13:16:01 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nPlease rerun the flow steps that encountered a problem.\nWe are continuing to investigate the root cause of the problem.\n**Workaround**\n27/10/22 13:32:44 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nFollowing the previous answer, the compute statistics on the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table committed many resources on the Calatog Server and the query Coordinator (dr1node02), resulting in REFRESH/INVALIDATE METADATA operations experiencing long execution times and causing jobs to time out. After the compute statistics were completed, Impala released the resources and resumed.\nAs we have communicated in the past, from our perspective the statistics of the table are not necessary. Please let us know if we can disable the production of statistics for this particular table.\n**Resolved**\n```\n6.

The issue was resolved by running the job in chunks and syncing results via distcp.\nFollowing ticket SD2221480, the failed job [IBank_Ingestion]-[MergeBatch]-[JOB] appeared again but for d1edge01.mno.gr\n## Actions Taken\nAfter communicating with the customer, we proceeded to manually kill the job as it was running for over 14 hours and was affecting live production flows.\nProceeding to investigate the issue, we saw the following:\n1. Going to Cloudera Manager => Yarn => Applications =>\n``\nname RLIKE '.*PROD_IBank_MergeBatch' and application_duration > 3h\n``\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/Yarn_Applications_Merge_Batch_Prod_Ibank.png)\nWe notice that the Merge batch for `20230531` was running `14 hours` without finishing.\n2. As a second step, let's check the number of records in `impala` and the space occupied in `hdfs` by each `par_dt` from `20230509` to `20230530`\nBelow we see the space at the `hdfs` level:\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/HDFS_du.png)\nThe number of records in `impala` as an example for the `par_dt` `20230511` and `20230512`:\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/impala_query_par_dt_count.PNG)\nWhat we observe above is that while the `par_dt` `20230511` and `20230512` they have no difference in the number of records, they are twice as large. Where did this come from and what impact does it have? We will analyze it in the next steps.\n3. Let's see how this increase came about:\nAnalyzing the sum of length for response_text_data for each service, we notice that from `12/05/2023` onwards the service_name `'/CAMPAIGNMANAGEMENT/GETCAMPAIGNS'` takes up much more space as shown below compared to previous days.\nAfter `20230512`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/After_20230512.png)\nBefore `20230512`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/Before_20230512.png)\nUntil 11/05/2023 the average avg(length(response_text_data)) of prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit is stable at ~12K while from 12/05/2023 we see it approximately doubling.\nThis resulted in the `Merge Batch` not finishing as since the size of each `json` has doubled it takes much longer to execute the spark job.\n4. How did we handle it to get it running?\nAs described [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch) in the subchapter `If the problem is with resources (out-of-memory errors):` we ran the `Merge Batch` in separate chunks of the day.\nThe process took 3 days to complete as each chunk of the day took ~9 hours.\n5. After it was completed on one site, `distcp` was performed as described in [issue](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/20201218-IM1389913.md) for the `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit` and `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old` tables with `par_dt` `20230530` on the other site. Finally, on the other site, after `distcp` was completed, we ran [upsert-to-hbase-migration](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#upsert-to-hbase-migration)\n6. Finally, after all the steps were completed on both sites, the developers manually deleted the old data in `kudu`.\n> Ndef: After all the above was completed, we should proceed with the consultation with the bank, to execute the `DWH` flows for the days that did not run due to the above issue. The `DWH` flow was removed, so we did not need to take any action.\n---\ntitle: DWH LoanPayment Export Failed Due to Duplicate Primary Key in SQL Server",

After investigating the logs of the executor using internal firefox and the logs of the DWH_Ibank_MAN_DATE script we saw the following:\n`Cannot insert duplicate key in object srcib.MandateDetails. The duplicate key value is (e5435435-4354254235-121nfdgd33)`\nThat means that the table already has records in it, so we have to drop this records or invoke the script with the `-f` option that gives the ability to truncate the table and then insert the records. \n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t manDate -f\n```\nAfter executing the extract script, we use the same `-f` to run the export script.

        "chatbot_response": " A complex Impala query can lead to a cluster-wide service outage on DR due to the following reasons:\n1. **Resource Overcommitment**: Complex queries can consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, and I/O) from multiple nodes in the cluster. This can lead to resource starvation for other critical services running on the same nodes.\n2. **Impala Daemon Overload**: When a complex query is executed, it can overload the Impala daemon responsible for processing the query. This can cause the daemon to become unresponsive or even crash, leading to a cascade of failures across the cluster.\n3. **HBase and Sentry Service Disruptions**: Complex queries can also impact HBase and Sentry services, which are critical components of the BigStreamer architecture. Disruptions to these services can have far-reaching consequences, including data corruption, service outages, and even security breaches.\n4. **Cluster-Wide Service Outage**: The cumulative effect of resource overcommitment, Impala daemon overload, and disruptions to HBase and Sentry services can lead to a cluster-wide service outage on DR. This means that all services running on the DR cluster will become unavailable, resulting in significant downtime and potential data loss.\n\nIn summary, a complex Impala query can have far-reaching consequences for the entire BigStreamer architecture, leading to resource overcommitment, Impala daemon overload, disruptions to HBase and Sentry services, and ultimately, a cluster-wide service outage on DR.\n``` # mno - BigStreamer - SD1949713 - DR Cluster Service Disruptions\n## Description\nThe DR cluster triggered ~120 alert emails reporting unhealthy service status across the board.

The issue originated from a long-running query used in the IBANK Visible table upsert job, which was executed in single-node mode (via `set num_nodes = 1`). This forced the query to overload the coordinator daemon (pr1node04), which caused query blocking, client connection accumulation, and stalled streaming services.\nToday 02/03/2023 & 23:30 the Following alarms appeared on Cloudera:\n```\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node01)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node02)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node03)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node04)]\n[Pause Duration]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node05)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n------------\n[Impala: Daemon (pr1node06)]\n[Impala Concurrent Client Connections]\n```\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation\n1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site \n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\n![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\n> Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well.\n### Mitigation\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\n1st way: From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\n2nd way: From the url that we monitor the query.\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond.\n### Resolution\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality.\n7. Upon investigation, we concluded that the change to `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` that stops the parallel execution of the query by Impala daemons (set num_nodes = 1) was the cause of the problem.\n8. We scheduled to rerun the `Upsert to HBase` stage the following day after reverting the script to use all Impala daemons for parallel execution.\n### Long-Term Fix\n9.  On 03/03/2023 \n- we disabled HBase quotas for ` PROD_IBANK` namespace on PR Site according to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/22263_mno_HBASE_TUNING.docx) MoP\n- we removed `set num_nodes = 1` from `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`\n- reran the script\n10. The script ran successfully\n## Action Points\n1. We opened [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/67) issue to investigate and deploy a permanent fix for running `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` alongside HBase quotas.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 00:49:29 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe root cause is the same as ticket SD2158913.

The issue stems from physical user workloads (queries, jobs) monopolizing critical system resources\u2014specifically on `dr1node03` where MySQL is hosted. This results in Spark topologies entering a stalled state due to delayed authorization responses from the overloaded MySQL service.\nThe following alert appeared in the grafana system:\n```\n[DR][IBANK] Spark Waiting Batches Alert\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. The following text has been sent to mno/PM and explains the problem, as well as the recommended actions:\n```text\nSpark Waiting Batches Problem: The first and most important problem we have is the \"Spark Waiting Batches\" which opens a ticket for this monitoring. This is due to physical user actions (queries/jobs) that occupy/bind production resources on the disaster site mainly. This results in there being no resources available for the MySQL process (a central point that the entire cluster has a dependency on), the service that does the authorization is unable to process its data in the database and thus causes a delay in the spark topologies until the \"permission denied\" error is resolved. The spark topologies, while up and running, are unable to process the data, as a result of which they continue to execute after the execution of the jobs that occupied the resources on the server where the MySQL service is located has finished. We do not take any action in this nor can we do anything and mno has asked us to close the ticket directly.\nSuggestion: Disable Impala Daemon and YARN Node Manager on dr1node03.mno.gr, pr1node03.mno.gr where the primary MySQL service is located. This will not affect our cluster workload as, as you will see in the attached screenshots:\n1. impala_mean.png: The average memory occupied by Impala Daemon is much smaller than the limit (150GB) that we have set even in the evening hours when all the flows \"close\" the previous day and the largest load is concentrated on the cluster.\n```\n![impala mean usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_mean.PNG)\n``` text\n2. impala_total.png: The total memory commitment from Impala cumulatively for all nodes is at its peak about 500GB less than the total available, which means that by removing a node there will still be room for resources even with the addition of new flows\n```\n![impala total usage](.media/IM2099957/impala_total.PNG)\n```\n3. yarn.png: throughout the day, the available yarn resources are sufficient even with the removal of more than one node\nThe above applies to both sites and the screenshots are from the Disaster site, where the most resources are reserved compared to the 2 sites. It is important as in this MySQL has a dependency on the entire cluster.\n```\n![yarn usage](.media/IM2099957/yarn.PNG)\n``` text\nBy monitoring the remaining nodes of the 2 clusters, we see how they can manage the workload at CPU levels and with the above proposal we will reduce the CPU levels on critical node03 which anyway uses increased CPU for cluster management processes.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nmno Disaster Site\n## Action Points\n- [Issue 66 \u2013 Resource contention on MySQL node (Disable roles)](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/66)  \n- [Issue 196 \u2013 Cluster role optimization for Spark performance](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/196)\n---\ntitle: IBank MergeBatch Job Failed Due to HBase Quotas and Impala Resource Exhaustion\ndescription: The MergeBatch job for IBank_Ingestion failed due to Impala daemon resource exhaustion triggered by HBase namespace quotas and large data volume; workaround involved disabling quotas and rerunning in distributed mode.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - ibank\n  - mergebatch\n  - batch job\n  - impala\n  - hbase\n  - quotas\n  - pr1node04\n  - spark\n  - yarn\n  - resource exhaustion\n  - visible table\n  - service audit\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala concurrency\n  - code 6\n  - IM2095966\n  - impala parallelism\n  - spark-submit\n  - job retry\n  - prodrest\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2095966\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: HBase write quotas limited Impala to a single daemon, which crashed under end-of-month load, causing Impala connection pool exhaustion and failure of the MergeBatch job\n  resolution_summary: MergeBatch was rerun in 3 time windows after disabling quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace to allow full Impala daemon usage\n  workaround: quota removal and distributed rerun\n  affected_nodes:\n    - pr1node04\n    - pr1edge01\n  impacted_component: IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch (Spark + Impala + HBase)\n  customer_impact: night flows disrupted, visible table update delayed\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2095966 - Failed Batch Job on Grafana\n## Description\nThe MergeBatch job for the IBank_Ingestion pipeline failed on 28/02/2023 on the PR Site with a Grafana alert.

The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\nFor edge nodes:\n```\nsystemctl status cloudera-scm-agent\nsystemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent \n```\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\" \n# Restart Cloudera agents across all nodes to load new certificates\ndcli -C \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\"\n```\n```\ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server\" \ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-server\"\n```\n### Kudu Checks\nOpen UIs from masters and tablets from internal firefox from edge nodes. Firefox launced with your personal Exxx account.\nLogs from kudu logs on every node:\n`tail -f /var/log/kudu/kudu-tserver.INFO` checks that the number will be equal to this number => `ls /u12/kudu/tablet/data/data/ | grep metadata | wc -l`, when the synchronization is successfully completed.\n#### Start flows\nStart ibank from edge Node as PRODREST\n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\nStart ibank visible from edge Node as PRODREST\n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_VISIBLE_STABLE.sh\n```\nStart online from edge Node as PRODREST\n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\nSimilarly from a DR edge node as DEVREST:\nStart ibank\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\nStart online\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\n### Applications checks\nWhen all Kudu Tablets are synchronized and **all flows are on RUNNING status** then:\nas user PRODREST from an edge node:\n```\nimpala-shell xr1edge.mno.gr -k -ssl\n```\nExecute the following query:\n```\nselect max(timestamp) as time, 'ibank' as application from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream union select max(timestamp) as time, 'online' as application from prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream;\n```\n---\ntitle: Kubernetes Certificate Renewal Procedure\ndescription: Yearly renewal process for expiring Kubernetes certificates on kubemaster1, kubemaster2, and kubemaster3 including backup, kubeadm certs renewal, and container restarts.\ntags: [kubernetes, certificates, renewal, kubeadm, kubemaster, static pods, downtime, cluster-admin, tls]\ncategory: infrastructure\nproduct: BigStreamer\nplatform: kubernetes\nconfidentiality: internal\n---\n# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring. In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n## Procedure\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n```bash\nsudo su -write the metadata block, tags at the end, tell me what do to clean it and tell me what descriptions to write in order for the document to be properly retrieved in my RAG chatbot\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n```\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n```bash\ncp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n```\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n```bash\nkubeadm  certs renew all\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n```\n- Run the following\n```bash\ncp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\ncp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. Edit the file /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config and replace the values of client-certificate-data and client-key-data with the ones copied from /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf.\nin order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n```bash\nkubeadm certs check-expiration\n```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n```bash\nkubectl get pods\n```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\n1bd22e95ef01        5a84bb672db8           \"kube-scheduler --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-scheduler_kube-scheduler-cti-cx1_kube-system_649aa160f1bd0840b2bb0f70b6493f99_9\ncf43799ae77d0       b6e18ffb844e6          \"kube-apiserver --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                 \n```\nStop containers IDs:\n```bash\nctrctl stop 1350c48cbfb5 1bd22e95ef01 cf3cb7655b99d\n```\n> Ndef_1: Keep in mind that when the containers will be stopped, there will be downtime\n> Ndef_2: Keep in mind that those pods are static so you don't need to kill them. They will be automatically restarted\n- Also delete core-dns pod:\n```bash\nkubectl get pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns\nNAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\ncoredns-64897985d-7dzkl   1/1     Running   3 (84d ago)   644d\ncoredns-64897985d-rw5kc   1/1     Running   0             83d\n```\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-64897985d-7dzkl  coredns-64897985d-rw5kc  -n kube-system\n```\n- Repeat the same procedure for `kubemaster2` and `kubemaster3`\n> Note: The user `incelligent` exists only on kubemaster1.

It avoids offset resets by controlling the stop/commit/start sequence of MirrorMakers on PR and DR Kafka clusters using Cloudera Manager, Kerberos-authenticated CLI tools, and timestamp-based offset commits.\\n## Scope\\nKafka MirrorMaker has been configured with auto.offsets.reset=false. This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\\n## Setup\\n1. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node01 and pr1node04:\\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\\n- Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\\n2. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06:\\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\\n- Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\\n3. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node01 and dr1node04:\\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\\n- Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\\n4. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node05 and dr1node06:\\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\\n- Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\\n## Procedure\\n### Stop All Kafka MirrorMakers Affecting PR Site\\n1.

It avoids offset resets by controlling the stop/commit/start sequence of MirrorMakers on PR and DR Kafka clusters using Cloudera Manager, Kerberos-authenticated CLI tools, and timestamp-based offset commits.\n## Scope\nKafka MirrorMaker has been configured with auto.offsets.reset=false. This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n## Setup\n1. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node01 and pr1node04:\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n- Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n2. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06:\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n- Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n3. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node01 and dr1node04:\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n- Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n4. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node05 and dr1node06:\n- Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n- Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n- Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n- Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n## Procedure\n### Stop All Kafka MirrorMakers Affecting PR Site\n1.

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic. Usually only one site is active (Primary Site).\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Internet Banking Backend Servers] -->|HTTP Requests| B[Load Balancer - Netscaler]\n  B -->|Active| C[pr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -->|Active| D[pr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| E[dr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| F[dr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  C -->|Kafka Producer| G[Primary Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  D -->|Kafka Producer| G\n  E -.->|Stopped| H[Disaster Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  F -.->|Stopped| H\n```\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_wildfly.md)\n**Instructions for migrating traffic to DR site**: [Here](../procedures/failover.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- [PR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [DR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [PR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n- [DR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check application logs for error messages.\n- In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\n- If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Kafka performance.\n### Kafka Topic Mirroring via MirrorMaker\nDescribes the Kafka MirrorMaker setup that replicates `-mir` topics from the active site to final shared topics used by both clusters.\nAfter being published to Kafka, the traffic is mirrored to the opposite site via Kafka MirrorMaker. In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n#### PR replication\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n\n```\n#### DR replication\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n```\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n### Spark Streaming Pipelines\nSpark topologies consume Kafka events and write them to Kudu and HBase, separating full stream and visible-only transactions.\nAfter being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream\nThis topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Create and Pre-Split HBase Table\nThis section creates the usertable using pre-splitting to distribute load evenly across regionservers.\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n```bash\nhbase shell\nn_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', { SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map { |i| \"user#{1000 + i * (9999 - 1000) / n_splits}\" } }\n```\n## Install and Configure YCSB\nThis section describes downloading YCSB, extracting it, and pointing it to the HBase configuration directory.\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n```bash\ntar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n```bash\nmkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\ncd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\ncp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n```bash\ncd ycsb-0.17.0\n```\n## Baseline HBase Performance Without Quotas\nRun workloads A\u2013F with YCSB against HBase before applying any read/write quotas to establish baseline metrics.\n- Load the data\n```bash\nbin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n```bash\nbin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n```bash\nhbase shell\ndisable 'usertable'\ndrop 'usertable'\nexists 'usertable'\nn_splits = 300\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', { SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map { |i| \"user#{1000 + i * (9999 -

IM2095966 - Failed Batch Job on Grafana\n## Description\nThe MergeBatch job for the IBank_Ingestion pipeline failed on 28/02/2023 on the PR Site with a Grafana alert. The failure occurred during the `JOB` component execution and was traced to Impala resource exhaustion caused by HBase write quotas and high data volume at end-of-month.\nThe following failed batch job appeared in the Grafana system:\n```\napplication :  IBank_Ingestion\njob_name : MergeBatch\ncomponent : JOB\ndate : 28-02-2023\nstatus : FAILED\ndescription :\nhost : pr1edge01.mno.gr\n```\n## Actions Taken\n1. We identified the failed step using the alarm name. Steps `MSSQL Sqoop Import (Migration)` and `Insert to Service Audit` had been executed successfully. We rerun the `Merge Batch` according to [this](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch).\n2. The job had not completed at approximately 9.pm on 01/03/2023 we terminated the job after communication with the customer in order for the night flow to run without any problems. We scheduled to rerun the job in the following day after the completion of the daily MergeBatch.\n3. On 02/03/2023 we reran the job in 3 patches \n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 00:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 12:00:00\" \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2023-02-28 18:00:00\" \"2023-03-01 00:00:00\"\n```\n4. The `Upsert to HBase` stage that synchronises the `Visible` table caused an Impala problem during which Impala stopped to process this job as well as other requests.\n5. The problem is described below.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\nG. Poulas\n03/03/23 00:53:26 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe service audit has been filled on the PR Site. The job that fills the visible table is pending as it was canceled in the context of ticket SD2159021.\n02/03/23 15:56:38 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nThe execution on both sites started after the scheduled execution of the Merge Batch for 01/03/2023, which has been completed without a problem. At this time, the DR has processed until 18:00, while the PR has processed the data until 12:00. The executions on both sites are being monitored so that they can be resubmitted in case of a problem.\n01/03/23 21:11:19 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\nFollowing our telephone communication, the job has been stopped and will be re-executed tomorrow in order to avoid problems with the evening streams.\n```\n---\ntitle: IBank HBase Batch Job Failure on DR Site Due to Oversized Row Key\ndescription: The IBank_Migration job \"Enrich HBase Visible Tables\" failed due to a row key exceeding HBase\u2019s 32,767-byte limit.

This triggered an `IllegalArgumentException` and caused the upsert to terminate abnormally. The issue was resolved by filtering out the violating row and rerunning the job with a modified script.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to Grafana `https://dr1edge02.mno.gr:3000` with personal account\n2. Inspected `LOCAL MONITORING`/`I-Bank Batch Jobs Overview` \n3. From the diagram stage `Enrich HBase Visible Tables` had failed\n4. According to [Hadoop Trac](http://999.999.999.999/trac/hadoop/wiki/dev/project/mno/support), execution is done with the following command:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`  >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log 2>&1\n```\n5. Connected  on MobaXterm via ssh to `dr1edge01` and changed user to `PRODREST` using sudo.\n7. Check the logs of failed script.Look for IllegalArgumentException in logs. \n```bash\nless /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log\n...\nWARNING: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Row length 34XXX is > 32767\n```\n8. After investigation this error indicates that the key column for the HBase table is greater than the limit, so the insert fails.\n9. Find how many lines are causing this error by executing the `SELECT` part of the query and adding `WHERE length(...)>32767` at the end:\n```sql\nSELECT\n        concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id),\n        'true',\n        'true',\n        originate_timestamp,\n        ...\nON a.service_name = b.name\nWHERE b.show_customer=TRUE\n       AND length(concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id))>32767;\n```\nThis query returned 1 row. Copy the above query into a file for future reference.\n10. Copy script `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`.\n11. Edit the copy. Append `AND length(concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id))<32767` at the end of the query.\n11. Execute the new script. Check the execution is successful.\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh.pqr `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`  >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log 2>&1\n```\n12.

The job was re-executed in three intervals to work around memory constraints. Postgres monitoring tables were manually updated to show job success, and the pipeline was resumed from the appropriate downstream step using a modified master script.\njob_name: MergeBatch\ncomponent: Job\nStatus: Failed\nHost: dr1edge01.mno.gr\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox\n2. At the YARN UI search for `PRODREST` and sort by End date. You will find the failed application.\n3. From the UI we saw that Spark exited due to OOM errors.\n4. Using this [document](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch) we executed Merge Batch in 3 steps in parallel:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 00:00:00\" \"2022-02-28 12:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 12:00:00\" \"2022-02-28 18:00:00\"\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2022-02-28 18:00:00\" \"2022-01-03 00:00:00\"\n```\n5. We updated the monitoring postgres database in order for the entry to appear green in Grafana. You can get a success query for Merge batch from the log file of the master script and change the dates. To confirm resolution, verify that Grafana shows no failed MergeBatch jobs for 2022-02-28.\n6. We created a copy of the master script as `PRODREST` at `dr1edge01`.\n7. nside the copied script, we removed the pre-processing steps before the [Distinct join to Service Audit](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#distinct-join-to-service-audit) stage.\n8. We executed the copy script and performed checks as ndefd in the support document.\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster Site IBank Batch\n---\ntitle: CSI-Redis Flow \u2013 Daily Export of CSI Metrics to

Validate Duplicate Job Execution in CDSW GUI\n1. Login to CDSW on https://mncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr with personal account.\n2. From the Admin tab select usage.\n3. Confirm duplicate submitted jobs.\n### 2. Access the CDSW Kubernetes Environment\n4. SSH to `mncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `root` with sudo\n### 3. Identify and Inspect the Cron Scheduler Pod\n5. Find the scheduler pod\n``` bash\nkubectl get pods\nNAME                                          READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE\narchiver-7c6656cf45-nklb2                     1/1

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Create and Pre-Split HBase Table\nThis section creates the usertable using pre-splitting to distribute load evenly across regionservers.\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n```bash\nhbase shell\nn_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', { SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map { |i| \"user#{1000 + i * (9999 - 1000) / n_splits}\" } }\n```\n## Install and Configure YCSB\nThis section describes downloading YCSB, extracting it, and pointing it to the HBase configuration directory.\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n```bash\ntar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n```bash\nmkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\ncd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\ncp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n```bash\ncd ycsb-0.17.0\n```\n## Baseline HBase Performance Without Quotas\nRun workloads A\u2013F with YCSB against HBase before applying any read/write quotas to establish baseline metrics.\n- Load the data\n```bash\nbin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n```bash\nbin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n```bash\nhbase shell\ndisable 'usertable'\ndrop 'usertable'\nexists 'usertable'\nn_splits = 300\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', { SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map { |i| \"user#{1000 + i * (9999 -

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Create and Pre-Split HBase Table\nThis section creates the usertable using pre-splitting to distribute load evenly across regionservers.\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n```bash\nhbase shell\nn_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', { SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map { |i| \"user#{1000 + i * (9999 - 1000) / n_splits}\" } }\n```\n## Install and Configure YCSB\nThis section describes downloading YCSB, extracting it, and pointing it to the HBase configuration directory.\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n```bash\ntar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n```bash\nmkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\ncd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\ncp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n```bash\ncd ycsb-0.17.0\n```\n## Baseline HBase Performance Without Quotas\nRun workloads A\u2013F with YCSB against HBase before applying any read/write quotas to establish baseline metrics.\n- Load the data\n```bash\nbin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n```bash\nbin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n```bash\nhbase shell\ndisable 'usertable'\ndrop 'usertable'\nexists 'usertable'\nn_splits = 300\ncreate 'usertable', 'family', { SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map { |i| \"user#{1000 + i * (9999 -

It explains how to enable HBase throttling via Cloudera Manager, configure namespace-specific read and write request limits using the HBase shell, and cleanly remove quotas when no longer needed. Steps include using kinit, navigating HBase processes, and verifying changes through list_quotas.\n## Step 1: Enable Global HBase Quotas via Cloudera Manager\n1. Go to ```Cloudera Manager => HBase => Configuration => HBase Service Advanced configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml```\n2. Add the following configuration:\n```\nName: hbase.quota.enabled\nValue: true\nDescription: enable hbase quotas\n```\n3.

Get list of namespaces\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_namespace\n```\n4. Set throttle READ quotas \n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n```\n5. Set throttle WRITE quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n```\n6. Show all quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_quotas\n```\n## Step 3: Remove Namespace-Level Quotas\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n```bash\ncd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\nls \u2013ltr HBASE\ncd <latest hbase process folder>\nkinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n```\n3. Get list of namespaces and list of quotas already set\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_namespace\nlist_quotas\n```\n4. Delete throttle quotas\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'namespace', LIMIT => NONE\n```\n5. Verify that quotas have been removed\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_quotas\n```\n---\ntitle: IBank HBase Batch Job Failure on DR Site Due to Oversized Row Key\ndescription: The IBank_Migration job \"Enrich HBase Visible Tables\" failed due to a row key exceeding HBase\u2019s 32,767-byte limit.

This triggered an `IllegalArgumentException` and caused the upsert to terminate abnormally. The issue was resolved by filtering out the violating row and rerunning the job with a modified script.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to Grafana `https://dr1edge02.mno.gr:3000` with personal account\n2. Inspected `LOCAL MONITORING`/`I-Bank Batch Jobs Overview` \n3. From the diagram stage `Enrich HBase Visible Tables` had failed\n4. According to [Hadoop Trac](http://999.999.999.999/trac/hadoop/wiki/dev/project/mno/support), execution is done with the following command:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`  >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log 2>&1\n```\n5. Connected  on MobaXterm via ssh to `dr1edge01` and changed user to `PRODREST` using sudo.\n7. Check the logs of failed script.Look for IllegalArgumentException in logs. \n```bash\nless /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log\n...\nWARNING: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Row length 34XXX is > 32767\n```\n8. After investigation this error indicates that the key column for the HBase table is greater than the limit, so the insert fails.\n9. Find how many lines are causing this error by executing the `SELECT` part of the query and adding `WHERE length(...)>32767` at the end:\n```sql\nSELECT\n        concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id),\n        'true',\n        'true',\n        originate_timestamp,\n        ...\nON a.service_name = b.name\nWHERE b.show_customer=TRUE\n       AND length(concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id))>32767;\n```\nThis query returned 1 row. Copy the above query into a file for future reference.\n10. Copy script `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`.\n11. Edit the copy. Append `AND length(concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id))<32767` at the end of the query.\n11. Execute the new script. Check the execution is successful.\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh.pqr `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`  >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log 2>&1\n```\n12. In the Grafana charts, check that stage is green now.\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster Site IBANK\n---\ntitle: HBase RegionServer OOM and Spark Waiting Batches Alert on DR Site\ndescription: Spark streaming job in DR cluster failed due to HBase RegionServer OOM and high per-region traffic in PROD:BANK namespace; issue mitigated by restarting streaming job, root cause identified as uneven HBase load.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - hbase\n  - regionserver\n  - dr1edge01\n  - spark\n  - streaming\n  - online ingestion\n  - grafana\n  - spark waiting batches\n  - prodrest\n  - hbase hotspotting\n  - workload imbalance\n  - workaround\n  - hbase performance\n  - region load\n  - memory issue\n  - im1896751\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM1896751\n  system: mno BigStreamer - DR Site\n  root_cause: Spark job failure caused by HBase RegionServer Out-of-Memory errors due to hotspotting in PROD:BANK HBase namespace\n  resolution_summary: Streaming job resubmitted; HBase cluster stabilized; client advised to tune table design to reduce per-region load\n  workaround: Job manually restarted\n  downstream_risks: Potential recurrence unless application logic or table distribution is improved\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM1896751 - Alert in Grafana Application\n## Description\nA [DR][ONLINE] Spark Waiting Batches alert appeared in Grafana, indicating a failure in the Spark streaming job on the DR site.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox\n2. At the YARN UI search for `PRODREST` and sort by End date. You will find the failed application.\n3. From the UI we saw that Spark exited due to errors related to HBase timeouts.\n4. From DR site's Cloudera Manager we saw that HBase Regionservers restarted due to Out-Of-Memory errors and are now healthy again.\n5. Using this [document](/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/online.md#spark-streaming) we re-submitted the failed topology and the alarm was cleared:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n6. We informed the customer that a **workaround** has been implemented. The ticket status from this point is \"Workaround Provided\".\n7. The logs and resources charts from Cloudera Manager did not indicate a specific reason for the restarts.\n8. After investigating HBase tables we identified that 2 tables from the `PROD_BANK` namespace although they have low traffic overall, they have high traffic per region. Since each region is hosted on only one Regionserver, so this application pattern creates hotspots on specific servers and does not utilize the whole cluster properly. Below you can find the charts that show this behavior.\nWorkload per region\n```sql\nselect delete_rate_across_hregions WHERE category = HTABLE and htabIeName RLIKE 'PROD*'\n```\n![DR_DELETE.PNG](.media/DR_DELETE.PNG)\n![DR_DELETE_12H.PNG](.media/DR_DELETE_12H.PNG)\n```sql\nselect get_rate_across_hregions WHERE category = HTABLE and htabIeName RLIKE 'PROD*'\n```\n![DR_GET.PNG](.media/DR_GET.PNG)\n![DR_GET_12H.PNG](.media/DR_GET_12H.PNG)\n```sql\nselect increment_rate_across_hregions + append_rate_across_hregions + mutate_rate_across_hregions WHERE category = HTABLE and htabIeName RLIKE 'PROD*'\n```\n![DR_WRITE.PNG](.media/DR_WRITE.PNG)\n![DR_WRITE_12H.PNG](.media/DR_WRITE_12H.PNG)\nUneven workload between Regionservers\n```sql\nselect read_requests_rate, write_requests_rate\n```\n![DR_LOAD_REGIONS.PNG](.media/DR_LOAD_REGIONS.PNG)\n![DR_LOAD_REGIONS_12H.PNG](.media/DR_LOAD_REGIONS_12H.PNG)\n## Our Ticket Response\n9. Inform the customer of the findings\n```\nThe problem did not occur today. Looking at the overall picture of HBase, we notice that its usage has increased significantly. Specifically, we see tables in the Namespace \"PROD:BANK\" with a high workload throughout the day and with an application-level configuration that creates uneven load distribution between Region Servers.\nYou should immediately proceed with the actions that have been suggested for benchmarking and tuning HBase as a service and the applications that use it in order to optimize its use.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster Site HBase\n---\ntitle: IBank MergeBatch Job Failed Due to HBase Quotas and Impala Resource Exhaustion\ndescription: The MergeBatch job for IBank_Ingestion failed due to Impala daemon resource exhaustion triggered by HBase namespace quotas and large data volume; workaround involved disabling quotas and rerunning in distributed mode.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - ibank\n  - mergebatch\n  - batch job\n  - impala\n  - hbase\n  - quotas\n  - pr1node04\n  - spark\n  - yarn\n  - resource exhaustion\n  - visible table\n  - service audit\n  - impala daemon\n  - impala concurrency\n  - code 6\n  - IM2095966\n  - impala parallelism\n  - spark-submit\n  - job retry\n  - prodrest\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2095966\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR Site\n  root_cause: HBase write quotas limited Impala to a single daemon, which crashed under end-of-month load, causing Impala connection pool exhaustion and failure of the MergeBatch job\n  resolution_summary: MergeBatch was rerun in 3 time windows after disabling quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace to allow full Impala daemon usage",

Investigation showed that the alert was caused by excessive block count due to the absence of a retention policy for the `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old` table in Hive. Manual purging of old partitions was performed to mitigate the issue.\n## Actions Taken\n1. Login to Cloudera Manager in DR and check the alarm\n2. It was a block count alarm on `dr1node09`\n3. Login to `dr1edge01` with your personal account and execute `firefox` to view the Namenode UI.\n4. Go to `https://dr1node02.mno.gr:50470` and from there in the tab `Datanodes`. Order the datanodes using the block count by desceding order to overview the situation.\n5. Change user to PRODREST and use HDFS command or Impala query to check how many partitions exist in `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. This is a big table that has no retention mechanism yet so its data are stored in many blocks. HDFS command is `hdfs dfs -ls /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old` and Impala query is `show partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. In either case observe how many `par_dt` directories exist.\n6. In our case there were at least 6 months in there so we informed mno. Sample customer notification:\n```text\nRegarding ticket SD1734269, the error shown in Cloudera Manager refers to a block count threshold exceeded on dr1node09 and is due to the increased number of blocks stored on the new nodes dr1node07-10. The impact on the datanode lies in the performance as the metadata for the blocks it has in memory does not fit.\nFrom the investigation we did in the HDFS data, we saw that there are many files in the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old table. Specifically, there is history in it from 01/03.\nBy keeping only recent data through a retention mechanism, the total block count in HDFS and on each datanode individually will be reduced.\nAs an immediate solution, we suggest deleting data older than 40 days, as has been done in the past. Consequently, it will not be possible to investigate problems that occurred older than 40 days.\nPlease let us know if you agree with the above and when you would like us to proceed with the immediate solution.\n```\nRecipients are `ZEVGAROPOULOU.GEORGIA@mno.gr,krekoukias.konst@mno.gr,papakostas.athanasios@mno.gr`. Add our team and kbikos in CC.\n5. When mno agreed to the immediate action, we informed the monitoring team to ignore alarms in Cloudera Manager of DR site regarding HDFS, Hive, Impala and YARN. Their email address is `csocmonitoringops@jkl-telecom.com`. Example mail:\n```\nWe will proceed with actions on the National Bank of Greece Disaster Site infrastructure.\nDuring this time, you will probably have alarms in the Cloudera Manager UI related mainly to the Health of HDFS, Hive, Impala, Yarn.\nThe work will start at 16:40 today. We will inform you after the work is completed.\n```\n8. When the time comes, login to Grafana and check charts of topologies running in DR. Login to Cloudera Manager and check throughout the process the health status of Cloudera services. Ndef that `Hive Metastore Canary` alerts will pop up as expected.\n9. Login to dr1edge01 with your personal account and change user to `PRODREST`.\n10. Open an impala shell on DR:`impala-shell -i pr1edge.mno.gr -k --ssl`.\n11. Change database to `prod_trlog_ibank` with `use prod_trlog_ibank;` and `show tables;` to check that `service_audit_old` is here.\n12. Drop partitions. Seperate the amount of days you have to delete in batches of 15 days in order to avoid disruptions of applications. `ALTER TABLE service_audit_old DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION(par_dt<=20200715) PURGE;`\n12. When the query is done, execute the next one and so on: `ALTER TABLE service_audit_old DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION(par_dt<=20200801) PURGE;`\n13. Can't stress this enough. **Throughout steps 12, 13 check Grafana and Cloudera Manager**.\n14. When done, inform mno and the monitoring team that actions have been successfully finished.\n## Affected Systems\nmno Bigstreamer\n## Action Points\nDevelop retention mechanism to automatically drop old partitions.\n---\ntitle: All Hosts Report Critical State in Cloudera Due to NFS Unavailability\ndescription: Cloudera Manager reported all nodes on PR and DR clusters as critical due to NFS unavailability, which prevented the Host Monitor from collecting filesystem metrics; confirmed false alarm as flows ran successfully and issue cleared after freeing up NFS space.\ntags:\n  - mno\n  - bigstreamer\n  - cloudera manager\n  - nfs\n  - host monitor\n  - node metrics\n  - pr1edge01\n  - dr1edge01\n  - grafana\n  - critical state\n  - cloudera-scm-agent\n  - timeout\n  - cluster health\n  - false positive\n  - im2241809\nlast_updated: 2025-05-01\nauthor: ilpap\ncontext:\n  issue_id: IM2241809\n  system: mno BigStreamer PR & DR Sites\n  root_cause: NFS mount point on all nodes became unavailable due to full capacity, preventing Host Monitor from retrieving metrics\n  resolution_summary: NFS space was freed, restoring monitoring functionality; services remained operational throughout the incident\n  affected_nodes:\n    - pr1edge01\n    - dr1edge01\n    - all PR/DR hosts\n  false_alert: true\n---\n# mno - BigStreamer - IM2241809 - Every Host on PR1 and DR1 are in critical state\n## Description\nAll nodes in PR and DR clusters appeared as critical in Cloudera Manager due to NFS becoming unavailable. This prevented the Host Monitor from retrieving node metrics. However, all jobs continued to run correctly and the issue was resolved after the NFS storage was freed.\nAll Hosts in Dr1 and PR1 are in critical state\n## Actions Taken\n### Investigation Steps\n1. Login to `PR` and `DR` cloudera manager in order to check the health of each cluster. The status was unhealthy for all services on both clusters.\n2. Login to `Grafana` in order to check that applications running. All the applications were running without errors.\n3. ssh to `pr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account\n4. sudo to root\n5. Move to the log folder:\n```bash\ncd /var/log\n```\n6. Check messages file\n```bash\nless messages\n```\nThe output was:\n![image](.media/IM2241809/pr1edge01_messages.png)\n7. From the above output we saw that at `22:13:02 pr1edge01_kernel: nfs: server 999.999.999.999 not responding`.\n8. Now lets check the `agent logs` of an internal node.\n9. ssh to `pr1node03.mno.gr` with personal account\n10. sudo to root\n11. Move to the log folder:\n```bash\ncd /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent\n```\n12. Check `cloudera-scm-agent.log` file\n```bash\nless cloudera-scm-agent.log\n```\nThe output was:\n![image](.media/IM2241809/pr1node03_agent_logs.png)\n13. Due to unavaliability of `nfs storage`(responisibility of the customer to maintain), `Host Monitor` service of Cloudera management services had `timeout` errors because couldn't collect metrics from each filesystem of the nodes.\n14. Customer informed that `nfs storage` caused the issue on both clusters and the unhealthy state of all services was not real because `Host Monitor` was not able to collect metrics in order to be appeared on `CM`. Also all flows ran without errors during the issue.\n15. Customer informed us that the `nfs` storage was full and after their actions it's ok. We checked the `CM` and all the services now is healthy.\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThis problem occurred due to `nfs` unavaliability.\n## Our Ticket Response\n```\nThe issue was caused by the nfs storage used on the nodes of both clusters becoming full. This resulted in the host monitor of the cloudera management services timeouting as it was unable to collect metrics for each filesystem of the nodes.\nRelevant screenshots are attached showing the above causes of the issue.\nThroughout the issue, the flows were up and running as seen in grafana as it was a malfunction of the management services resulting in the incorrect image of all services in Cloudera Manager PR & DR respectively.\nAfter space was freed up on the nfs, both clusters returned to good health.\n```\n## Affected Systems\nDisaster/Primary Site\n---\ntitle: Postgres 14 Upgrade Procedure\ndescription: Detailed instructions for upgrading PostgreSQL from version 9.5 to 14 on PR and DR edge nodes in the BigStreamer environment, including data backup, repository setup, YUM installation, and rollback steps.\ntags:\n  -

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic. Usually only one site is active (Primary Site).\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Internet Banking Backend Servers] -->|HTTP Requests| B[Load Balancer - Netscaler]\n  B -->|Active| C[pr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -->|Active| D[pr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| E[dr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| F[dr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  C -->|Kafka Producer| G[Primary Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  D -->|Kafka Producer| G\n  E -.->|Stopped| H[Disaster Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  F -.->|Stopped| H\n```\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_wildfly.md)\n**Instructions for migrating traffic to DR site**: [Here](../procedures/failover.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- [PR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [DR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [PR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n- [DR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check application logs for error messages.\n- In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\n- If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Kafka performance.\n### Kafka Topic Mirroring via MirrorMaker\nDescribes the Kafka MirrorMaker setup that replicates `-mir` topics from the active site to final shared topics used by both clusters.\nAfter being published to Kafka, the traffic is mirrored to the opposite site via Kafka MirrorMaker. In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n#### PR replication\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n\n```\n#### DR replication\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n```\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n### Spark Streaming Pipelines\nSpark topologies consume Kafka events and write them to Kudu and HBase, separating full stream and visible-only transactions.\nAfter being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream\nThis topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.

The container name for the application is \"monitoring-app-{version}\". \n\n    Please provide a step-by-step guide on how to stop the Wildfly instance for Internet Banking (prodrestib) using the provided context.\n\n    Answer:\n    To stop the Wildfly instance for Internet Banking (prodrestib), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Connect to the node**: SSH into the node where the Wildfly instance is running, e.g., `pr1edge01.mno.gr`.\n\n2. **Become the root user or PRODREST user**: Use `sudo su` to become the root user or use `sudo su - PRODREST` to become the PRODREST user.\n\n3. **Stop the Wildfly instance using supervisord**: Run the command `supervisorctl stop wildfly-prodrestib`.\n\n4. **Verify the Wildfly instance has stopped**: Check the status of the Wildfly instance using `supervisorctl status wildfly-prodrestib`. The output should indicate that the process is not running.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure a clean and controlled shutdown of the Wildfly instance for Internet Banking (prodrestib). \n\n    Question:\n    What are the host nodes where the monitoring application is deployed?\n\n    Answer:\n    The monitoring application is deployed on two host nodes: un5.bigdata.abc.gr and un6.bigdata.abc.gr.\n\n    Question:\n    How can you check if the container running the monitoring app is active or stopped, and how to restart it when necessary?\n\n    Answer:\n    You can use the following commands to check the status of the container and restart it when necessary:\n\n- `sudo docker ps --filter=\"name=monitoring-app-{version}\" --filter=\"status=running\"`\n- `sudo docker ps --filter=\"name=monitoring-app-{version}\" --filter=\"status=exited\"`\n- `sudo docker stop monitoring-app-{version}`\n- `sudo docker start monitoring-app-{version}`\n\n    Question:\n    What is the purpose of the monitoring application, and how does it interact with the BigStreamer infrastructure?\n\n    Answer:\n    The monitoring application is designed to monitor all streaming and batch jobs through HTTP calls. The application writes requests to a database and metrics about its performance are written to Graphite.\n\n    The monitoring application interacts with the BigStreamer infrastructure by sending HTTP requests to the Load Balancer (HAProxy) at un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800. The requests are then routed to the container running the monitoring application.\n\n    Question:\n    What is the purpose of the Wildfly instances in the BigStreamer infrastructure, and how do they interact with the Load Balancers and the backend servers?\n\n    Answer:\n    The Wildfly instances in the BigStreamer infrastructure are used to deploy and manage Java-based applications. In this case, the Wildfly instances are used to host the Internet Banking and Online applications.\n\n    The Wildfly instances interact with the Load Balancers (Netscaler) as follows:\n\n- The Load Balancer receives incoming traffic from clients and routes it to the available Wildfly instances.\n- Each Wildfly instance is configured to listen on a specific port (e.g., 8080 for Internet Banking).\n- When a client request is received by the Load Balancer, it is routed to one of the available Wildfly instances.\n- The Wildfly instance processes the client request and returns the response to the Load Balancer.\n- The Load Balancer receives the response from the Wildfly instance and forwards it to the client.\n\n    Question:\n    What are the steps involved in stopping a Wildfly instance for Internet Banking (prodrestib",

The applications that handle the HTTP calls are installed on the edge servers of both sites. At normal operation only one site is active. These applications are deployed on top of Wildfly instances. There are four sets of Wildfly installations one for the `ibank` flow and one for the `online` flow and two others for applications developed by mno. All application servers are managed by `supervisord` owned by `root` user.\n**DEV/QA Information**:\nThe information below are written for the Production enviroment. There is a development/QA environment that runs only on DR site. In case of a problem the paths are exactly the same if you substitute the `prod` with the `dev` prefix. For the networking part of the DEV/QA environment use the [Network Information](#network-information) chapter\n### Glossary\n- NetScaler: Loadbalancer managed by mno. It handles SSL offloading\n- VIP: Virtual IP of the Loadbalancer\n- SNIP: IP of the Loadbalancer that initiates the connection to Wildfly instances\n- Health check: Endpoint that the Loadbalancer uses to determine if a specific Wildfly instance is active. It expects a `HTTP 200/OK` response\n## Setup\n### Internet Banking Wildfly Instances\n#### prodrestib\nHandles ingestion and queries for the Internet Banking (`ibank`) flow.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Port**: `8080`\n**Health Check Endpoint**: `/trlogibank/app`\n**Supervisor Configuration**: `/etc/supervisor.d/wildfly-prodrestib.ini`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\n#### prodrestibmetrics\nHosts applications developed by mno and accessed by the Internet Banking backend servers. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Port**: `8081`\n**Health Check Endpoint**: `/ibankmetrics/app`\n**Supervisor Configuration**: `/etc/supervisor.d/wildfly-prodrestibmetrics.ini`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestibmetrics/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `Managed by mno`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestibmetrics/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestibmetrics/access.log`\n### Internet Banking Loadbalancer farms\nThere are two active Loadbalancers for Internet Banking.

Inspect the Jobs in question.\nThe jobs are in `FAILED` status. The logs for the failed applications are missing.\n### 2. Investigate Job Pod Failures in Kubernetes\n5. Troubleshoot from the command line:\nFrom `mncdsw1` as root (use personal account and then sudo):\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -w -A # Wait a pod to fail (namespace should be like default-user-XXX)\n# After a while, a pod has failed, describe it\nkubectl describe pod -n default-user-XXX XXXXXXXX\n```\n### 3.

Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account\n2. Inspected `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`\n3. From the `Monitoring Alerts` check the graphs `spark waiting batches` to find which topology has delays`\n4. Open MobaXterm `dr1edge01` ssh with your personal account\n5. Execute `firefox`\n6. Click the `DR` bookmark\n7. Check the logs of failed spark topology.\n8. Login to `DR cloudera manager` with your personal account\n9. Go to `CHARTS-->KAFKA_KUDU_DISK_UTIL` and see if abnormal rates on disk util exists\n10. Using Firefox on `dr1edge01`, navigate to the Kudu tablet Web UI for each DR node and inspect the **Memory Usage (detailed)** section. If any tablet exceeds 90% memory usage, restart the affected Kudu tablet via Cloudera Manager or systemd.\n11. Check again the graphs `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`\n12. If the alert appeared `(in our case appeared on PROD_Online_IngestStream topology)` restart the specific topology\n13. Open a new tab on MobaXterm `dr1edge01` ssh with your personal account\n14. sudo -iu `PRODREST`\n15. yarn application -list | grep \"PROD_Online_IngestStream\"\n16. yarn application -kill `<application_id>`\n17. Start again the topology `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh`\n18. Check from Graphana again the graphs `Monitoring Alerts` and `Monitoring DR\\PR`.\n19. Go to spark jobs history and click running.\n20. Click `Running-->Online_Ibank_IngestStream-->Streaming`\n21.

Recovery required manual reruns, HDFS replication, Spark resource tuning, and Kudu partition management.\nCheck the merge batch in DR/pr for 2/29. It seems to be still running. We have disabled it on 1/31 until this is finished.\n## Investigation\n> Ndef: All log paths and query executions are found/executed from pr1edge01/dr1edge01.\n1. Login to Grafana and make sure that the failed step is the Merge Batch.\n2. Login to DR/PR edge nodes and through the node's firefox check YARN at https://dr1node03:8090 and https://pr1node03:8090 for the PROD_Ibank merge batch job.\n3. Check the stages tab for stages that have been completed for this job. At PR the `insert into` stages had completed after 8h. The RDD stages had failed and continued failing.\n![Yarn UI](.media/IM2285747_1.png)\n![Spark Stages](.media/IM2285747_2.png)\n4. The 8 hour mark gives us some clues as to the failure. In essence after 8 hours kerberos tickets are dropped, leading to continuous authentication failures and timeouts as shown in the logs `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log`.\n5. Checked the merge batch logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_v2.log` and `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log` and indeed we found authorization errors.\n6. Checked the size and count of the `service_audit_old` table through Impala and HDFS and it was found to be among the largest ever both in size (over 115 GB) and count (60 mil). The query used is `select  count(*) from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old where par_dt=20240229`.\n7. Inspecting the submition script we can see that for each individual sub-script the date is generated anew in the sub-script invocation. This means that since the merge in question spanned multiple dates, all steps started after the day's end wouldn't have completed succesfully.\n8. Inspecting the range partitions through Impala with the query `show range partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream`, we can find multiple leftover range partitions since November. This added further computation time for the already large table.\n### Investigation for 05/03:\nFor this day, while the size and count were not unusually large the last step of the process, ie. the\nhbase upsert took unusually long and couldn't complete on its own. The process seemed to get stuck on 1\nsingular task as shown by the logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log`, which leads us to conclude that a certain record was problematic because all tasks completed\nnormally except a specific one that kept failling even on re-runs.\n### Investigation - Summary:\n- Greater than most end of the month dates size(over 115 GB) and count (60 mil)\n- Multiple leftover range partitions\n- Execution spanning multiple days, triggering the dynamic date issue with the submition script\n- Stage execution surpassing the 8 hour mark, triggering a known kerberos authorization bug\n- Problematic record for 05/03\n## Resolution\n1. Since the data was already loaded into PR for 29/2, the rest of the steps were executed manually on it according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#batch instructions for steps beyond the Merge Batch .\n2. For all the remaining dates since 29/2 and because the cron jobs were stopped, each day was executed manually in full in each site, half of them (days) in PR and half of them (days) in DR following all the steps in the sub-steps guide from https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md .\n3. For each job completed in one site it was replicated over to the other using HDFS replication, through the destination's Cloudera Manager for both `service_audit` and `service_audit_old` tables. **A similar procedure for table replication exists in [Table Replication](./20201218-IM1389913.md) but not for HDFS replication.**\n- /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old/par_dt=$date\n- /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit/par_dt=$date\n4. Once replicated the HBase Upsert step was run on the destination site according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\n5. HBase markers were manually set for each job that didn't complete automatically according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\n6. Kudu range partitions were cleaned up manually for all previous days and 3 new partitions were created for the 3 previous days, in order for the cleanup script to continue functioning as nornal. More details on this can be found at the end of this document.\n### Resolution for 05/03 HBase Upsert\nFor this operation specifically more resources had to be allocated to the spark-submit job at `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert/submitVisibleTrnToHbaseIndexesDailyUpsert_STABLE.sh`. After its completion resources were reverted back to normal:\n```\nIncrease node count to 12\nDecrease core count to 1\nIncrease tasks to 40\n```\nKudu Range Partitions:\nRange partitions are created for the `service_audit_stream` table on the `u_timestamp` column. The commands to create and delete them\ncan be found below for some example dates. Ndef that those partitions are in UTC time, so the time to\ncreate/drop must be converted to local time, taking into account DST. For winter we are at GMT+2 so in order\nto include a full day it must range for 22:00 of the previous to 22:00 of the current (where current is the day you want to delete).\n```sh\n# Drop\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream drop range partition '2023-02-26T22:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-27T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\n\n# Create\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream add range partition '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-28T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\n```\nThe example above includes the first partition, which tracks from 1970 to the date in question. When deleting previous partitions, the first one\nmust be recreated in order to include the time from 1970 to the first date, and then you can create the daily partitions. For example, lets say we have\nthe following partitions:\n```\n| 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-11-29T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one in order to include a bigger range\n| 2023-11-29T22:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-11-30T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one due to policy\n| 2023-11-30T22:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-12-01T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one because it contains trash.

It covers the creation and maintenance of a local RPM repository on pr1node01, edge node backup and update procedures, handling of security certificates, switching Java versions using update-alternatives, and guidance for validating application behavior post-upgrade. Rollback steps are also provided.\nThis document outlines the upgrade process of minor java version for Oracle Java 1.8\non mno's edge nodes. All procedures pertain to PR and DR edge nodes, except the RPM repository\ncreation which is performed on pr1node1:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n## Step 1: Create Local RPM Repository\nThis step only needs to be performed once as all subsequent RPM's will be placed inside this\nrepository. SSH into **p1node01** and as root create the repository directories:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# mkdir -p /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n```\nDownload the desired RPMs from [Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html), place them inside\n`/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` and create the repository:\n```bash\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo .\n```\nSSH into one of the edge nodes, create the corresponding yum repo file and **scp** it into\nall other edge nodes:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxx@pr1edge01\n$ sudo -i\n# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo\n[oracle_java]\nname = oracle_java\nbaseurl =  http://p1node01.mno.gr/oracle_java\nenabled = 1\ngpgcheck = 0\n# scp /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo XXXedgeXX:/etc/yum.repos.d/\n```\nFinally on each edge node install the above packages:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum install jdk-1.8\n```\n## Step 2: Update the Repository with New RPMs\nDownload the desired version of Oracle Java 8 from\n[Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) or\n[Oracle Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and\nplace the RPMs inside `/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` of **pr1node01**. Login to\n**pr1node01** and update the repository with the new packages:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n$ sudo -i\n# cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n# createrepo --update .\n```\n## Step 3: Upgrade Java on Edge Hosts\n### Preparation\nBefore upgrading the edge nodes, their resources must be moved to other nodes and a backup\nof the old java be made. Login to each edge node:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# cp -rap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64/  /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/\n```\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n### Execution\nInside each edge node, update the java package using **YUM**:\n```bash\n# yum clean all\n# yum update java-1.8\n```\nCopy the old certificates into the new installation directory and run the update alternatives\ntool where you input the new version when prompted:\n```bash\n# cp -ap /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<old version>-amd64.bak/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts \\\n/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_<new version>-amd64/jre/lib/security/\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\nIf everything is OK unstandby the node and check each wildfly instance's access and\nserver logs for the following:\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/server.log`: There are no undeployed WARs\n- `/var/log/wildfly/*/access.log`: Everything is reporting HTTP 200 status\nDetailed wildfly information and management instructions can be found\n[here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/manage_wildfly.md).\n## Step 4: Rollback to Previous Java Version\nLogin to each edge node and downgrade using the update-alternatives and inputting the previous version:\n```bash\n$ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n$ sudo -i\n# update alternatives --config java * javac\n# java -version\n```\n---\ntitle: Postgres 14 Upgrade Procedure\ndescription: Detailed instructions for upgrading PostgreSQL from version 9.5 to 14 on PR and DR edge nodes in the BigStreamer environment, including data backup, repository setup, YUM installation, and rollback steps.\ntags:\n  -

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic. Usually only one site is active (Primary Site).\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Internet Banking Backend Servers] -->|HTTP Requests| B[Load Balancer - Netscaler]\n  B -->|Active| C[pr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -->|Active| D[pr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| E[dr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| F[dr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  C -->|Kafka Producer| G[Primary Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  D -->|Kafka Producer| G\n  E -.->|Stopped| H[Disaster Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  F -.->|Stopped| H\n```\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_wildfly.md)\n**Instructions for migrating traffic to DR site**: [Here](../procedures/failover.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- [PR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [DR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [PR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n- [DR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check application logs for error messages.\n- In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\n- If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Kafka performance.\n### Kafka Topic Mirroring via MirrorMaker\nDescribes the Kafka MirrorMaker setup that replicates `-mir` topics from the active site to final shared topics used by both clusters.\nAfter being published to Kafka, the traffic is mirrored to the opposite site via Kafka MirrorMaker. In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n#### PR replication\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n\n```\n#### DR replication\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n```\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n**Alerts**:\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n### Spark Streaming Pipelines\nSpark topologies consume Kafka events and write them to Kudu and HBase, separating full stream and visible-only transactions.\nAfter being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream\nThis topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.

The tables are partitioned based on the file name which contain a timestamp (e.g. \\*\\_20181121123916.csv -> par_dt='20181121'). \n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n    C[Remdef Sftp Server]\n    A[SFTP] -->
