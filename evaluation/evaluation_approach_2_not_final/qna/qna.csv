What is the correct procedure to resolve a failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data?,"To resolve the EXPORT job failure due to a duplicate key, first check for duplicate entries in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg` using Impala Shell. Then, create backup and temp tables, remove the duplicate entry by ID and timestamp, and overwrite the original table.

A batch job fails with Code 6 while trying to EXPORT loan payment data. What could be the cause and how should it be resolved?,Code 6 indicates a timeout in the sqoop-eval stage due to a SQLServer connection issue. The job did not proceed to sqoop-export. The solution is to rerun the job at a less busy time to avoid timeout:\n```bash\n# Example rerun\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\n```,Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution,"# mno - BigStreamer - IM2074270 - Failed Batch Job on Grafana\n\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```bash\nGood evening,\n\nThe following failed batch job appeared in the grafana system:\n\napplication : DWH_IBank\njob_name : EXPORT\ncomponent : LOAN_PAYMENT\ndate : 30-01-2023\nstatus : FAILED\ndescription : code 6\nhost : -\n```\n\n</b>Actions Taken:</b>\n\n1.

What causes a YARN Node Manager failure and how can it be mitigated?,"A Node Manager failure on pr1node01 was due to excessive disk usage from krb5kdc logs. These logs had grown to 80GB.

How should you run a MAN_DATE extract and export job when there is a duplicate key error?,Use the `-f` flag to force truncation before running extract and export scripts to avoid primary key constraint violations:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t manDate -f\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_export_details.sh -t manDate -f\n```,Application Functionality & Flow,"# mno - BigStreamer - IM2117067 - Grafana Batch Job failed\n\n<b>Description:</b>\n\nTitle: Batch Job Failed\nBody:\n```\nHello,\n\nToday 29/03 in Grafana application a failed Batch Job appeared.\n\nApplication : DWH_IBank\nJob_Name : Extract\nComponent: MAN_DATE\nDate: 28/03/23\nStatus: Failed\nDescription Code 1\n```\n\nInformation regarding the extract, logs etc. available [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/datawarehouse-ibank.md#man-date-extract) \n\nInformation regarding the export, logs etc. available [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/datawarehouse-ibank.md#man-date-export) \n\n</b>Actions Taken:</b>\n\nWe tried to invoke the Extract MAN_DATE script but it failed multiple times. After investigating the logs of the executor using internal firefox and the logs of the DWH_Ibank_MAN_DATE script we saw the following :\n\n`Cannot insert dublicate key in object srcib.MandateDetails. The dublicate key value is (e5435435-4354254235-121nfdgd33)`\n\n\nThat means that the table already has records in it, so we have to drop this records or invoke the script with the `-f` option that gives the ability to trancate the table and then insert the records. \n\n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t manDate -f\n```\n\nAfter executing the extract script, we use the same `-f` to run the export script. The reason that we are running export is because in the above mentioned step we run the extract and trancated the table so the export is neccessary. \n\n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_export_details.sh -t manDate -f\n```\n\nThe issue has been resolved by executing the above two commands. The key in this case was to find in the logs that we have dublicate keys. "

What is the procedure to continue the merge batch and HBase upsert process for failed DWH flows due to a stalled job on February 29?,Manually execute merge batch steps on PR site using instructions from the application flow documentation. Then use HDFS replication to copy data to DR and run the HBase upsert step using:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh 20240229\n```\nEnsure HBase markers and Kudu partitions are cleaned and reset properly using `alter table ... drop range partition` and `add range partition`.,Application Functionality & Flow,"# mno - BigStreamer - IM2285747 - merge batch 29/2\n\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```\nGood evening,\n\ncould you please check the merge batch in DR/pr for 2/29. It seems to be still running. We have disabled it on 1/31 until this is finished.\n\nThanks,\nThanos\n```\n\n<b>Investigation:</b>\n\n**Ndef**: All log paths and query executions are found/executed from pr1edge01/dr1edge01.\n\n1. Login to Grafana and make sure that the failed step is the Merge Batch.\n2. Login to DR/PR edge nodes and through the node's firefox check YARN at https://dr1node03:8090 and https://pr1node03:8090 for the PROD_Ibank merge batch job.\n3. Check the stages tab for stages that have been completed for this job. At PR the `insert into` stages had completed after 8h. The RDD stages had failed and continued failing.\n![Yarn UI](.media/IM2285747_1.png)\n![Spark Stages](.media/IM2285747_2.png)\n4. The 8 hour mark gives us some clues as to the failure. In essence after 8 hours kerberos tickets are dropped, leading to continuous authentication failures and timeouts as shown in the logs `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log`.\n5. Checked the merge batch logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_v2.log` and `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log` and indeed we found authorization errors.\n6. Checked the size and count of the `service_audit_old` table through Impala and HDFS and it was found to be among the largest ever both in size (over 115 GB) and count (60 mil). The query used is `select  count(*) from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old where par_dt=20240229`.\n7. Inspecting the submition script we can see that for each individual sub-script the date is generated anew in the sub-script invocation. This means that since the merge in question spanned multiple dates, all steps started after the day's end wouldn't have completed succesfully.\n8. Inspecting the range partitions through Impala with the query `show range partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream`, we can find multiple leftover range partitions since November. This added further computation time for the already large table.\n\nInvestigation for 05/03:\n\nFor this day, while the size and count were not unusually large the last step of the process, ie. the\nhbase upsert took unusually long and couldn't complete on its own. The process seemed to get stuck on 1\nsingular task as shown by the logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log`, which leads us to conclude that a certain record was problematic because all tasks completed\nnormally except a specific one that kept failling even on re-runs.\n\nInvestigation - Summary:\n\n- Greater than most end of the month dates size(over 115 GB) and count (60 mil)\n- Multiple leftover range partitions\n- Execution spanning multiple days, triggering the dynamic date issue with the submition script\n- Stage execution surpassing the 8 hour mark, triggering a known kerberos authorization bug\n- Problematic record for 05/03\n\n<b>Resolution:</b>\n\n1. Since the data was already loaded into PR for 29/2, the rest of the steps were executed manually on it\n   according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#batch instructions for\n   steps beyond the Merge Batch .\n2. For all the remaining dates since 29/2 and because the cron jobs were stopped, each day was executed\n   manually in full in each site, half of them (days) in PR and half of them (days) in DR following\n   all the steps in the sub-steps guide from https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md .\n3. For each job completed in one site it was replicated over to the other using HDFS replication, through\n   the destination's Cloudera Manager for both `service_audit` and `service_audit_old` tables. **A similar\n   procedure for table replication exists in [Table Replication](./20201218-IM1389913.md) but not for HDFS replication.**\n   - /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old/par_dt=$date\n   - /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit/par_dt=$date\n4. Once replicated the HBase Upsert step was run on the destination site according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\n5. HBase markers were manually set for each job that didn't complete automatically according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\n6. Kudu range partitions were cleaned up manually for all previous days and 3 new partitions were created\n   for the 3 previous days, in order for the cleanup script to continue functioning as nornal. More details\n   on this can be found at the end of this document.\n\n\nResolution for 05/03 HBase Upsert:\n\nFor this operation specifically more resources had to be allocated to the spark-submit job at `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert/submitVisibleTrnToHbaseIndexesDailyUpsert_STABLE.sh`. After its completion resources were reverted back to normal:\n```\nIncrease node count to 12\nDecrease core count to 1\nIncrease tasks to 40\n```\n\nKudu Range Partitions:\n\nRange partitions are created for the `service_audit_stream` table on the `u_timestamp` column. The commands to create and delete them\ncan be found below for some example dates. Ndef that those partitions are in UTC time, so the time to\ncreate/drop must be converted to local time, taking into account DST. For winter we are at GMT+2 so in order\nto include a full day it must range for 22:00 of the previous to 22:00 of the current (where current is the day you want to delete).\n\n```sh\n# Drop\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream drop range partition '2023-02-26T22:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-27T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\n\n# Create\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream add range partition '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-28T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\n```\n\nThe example above includes the first partition, which tracks from 1970 to the date in question. When deleting previous partitions, the first one\nmust be recreated in order to include the time from 1970 to the first date, and then you can create the daily partitions. For example, lets say we have\nthe following partitions:\n\n```\n| 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-11-29T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one in order to include a bigger range\n| 2023-11-29T22:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-11-30T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one due to policy\n| 2023-11-30T22:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-12-01T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one because it contains trash.

"What caused the Merge Batch job failure on 2023-05-31, and how was it resolved?","The failure was due to increased response sizes for service `/CAMPAIGNMANAGEMENT/GETCAMPAIGNS`, doubling average JSON size post 2023-05-12. The job was split into time chunks and run over three days. After completion, `distcp` was used for replication and upsert to HBase executed.",Data Management & Query Execution,"# mno - BigStreamer - IM2158906 - Failed job at Grafana\n\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```\nGood evening\nFollowing ticket SD2221480, the failed job [IBank_Ingestion]-[MergeBatch]-[JOB] appeared again but for d1edge01.mno.gr\n\nThank you.\n```\n\n<b>Actions Taken:</b>\nAfter communicating with the customer, we proceeded to manually kill the job as it was running for over 14 hours and was affecting live production flows.\n\nProceeding to investigate the issue, we saw the following:\n\n1. Going to Cloudera Manager => Yarn => Applications =>\n\n``\nname RLIKE '.*PROD_IBank_MergeBatch' and application_duration > 3h\n``\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/Yarn_Applications_Merge_Batch_Prod_Ibank.png)\n\nWe notice that the Merge batch for `20230531` was running `14 hours` without finishing.\n\n2. As a second step, let's check the number of records in `impala` and the space occupied in `hdfs` by each `par_dt` from `20230509` to `20230530`\n\nBelow we see the space at the `hdfs` level:\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/HDFS_du.png)\n\nThe number of records in `impala` as an example for the `par_dt` `20230511` and `20230512`:\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/impala_query_par_dt_count.PNG)\n\nWhat we observe above is that while the `par_dt` `20230511` and `20230512` they have no difference in the number of records, they are twice as large. Where did this come from and what impact does it have? We will analyze it in the next steps.\n\n3. Let's see how this increase came about:\n\nAnalyzing the sum of length for response_text_data for each service, we notice that from `12/05/2023` onwards the service_name `'/CAMPAIGNMANAGEMENT/GETCAMPAIGNS'` takes up much more space as shown below compared to previous days.\n\nAfter `20230512`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/After_20230512.png)\n\nBefore `20230512`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/Before_20230512.png)\n\nUntil 11/05/2023 the average avg(length(response_text_data)) of prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit is stable at ~12K while from 12/05/2023 we see it approximately doubling.\n\nThis resulted in the `Merge Batch` not finishing as since the size of each `json` has doubled it takes much longer to execute the spark job.\n\n4. How did we handle it to get it running?\n\nAs described [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch) in the subchapter `If the problem is with resources (out-of-memory errors):` we ran the `Merge Batch` in separate chunks of the day.\n\nThe process took 3 days to complete as each chunk of the day took ~9 hours.\n\n5. After it was completed on one site, `distcp` was performed as described in [issue](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/20201218-IM1389913.md) for the `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit` and `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old` tables with `par_dt` `20230530` on the other site. Finally, on the other site, after `distcp` was completed, we ran [upsert-to-hbase-migration](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#upsert-to-hbase-migration)\n\n6. Finally, after all the steps were completed on both sites, the developers manually deleted the old data in `kudu`.\n\nNdef:\n\nAfter all the above was completed, we should proceed with the consultation with the bank, to execute the `DWH` flows for the days that did not run due to the above issue. The `DWH` flow was removed, so we did not need to take any action."

"How is the Radius flow triggered, and what are the key processing steps for radacct data?","The Radius flow is triggered every 1h and 30 minutes via a coordinator. Files are fetched from the input SFTP server and stored temporarily. Then they are decompressed, loaded into Hive (staging tables), and enriched using reference data.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\n\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n\n### Ingestion Endpoint\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n\n### Check application status\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n\n## Application Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\""/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\"") --> B(\""/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\"")\n  B -- 1.

Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`\n\nThe specific order in which they are called is the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[\""export_*_kpis.sh<br><i>IPVPN-SLA</i>\""] -->B[compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh]\nB -->C[query_sm.sh]\nC --/ingest-query-->D(SM Application)\nstyle A fill:darkgray\nstyle B fill:#ECECEC\nstyle C fill:#ECECEC\n```\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nStop/Start guide on [abc_BigStreamer_Apps_MoP_Restart.docx](https://ghi.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/abcBigData/EZsK97GxFyVHkeBoFTFjuRYBtPF7lK86cTA44wMhayNlNA?e=Gjh0ZO)  \nCheck project wiki [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#deployment-instructions)\n\n\n## SQM Token Authentication\nThe authentication on the SQM server is done with the HTTP Token Auth in IPVPN-SM application. It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n\n# Failure Handling\n## Logs\n\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\n\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n\n\n# Support\n\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \""IPVPN-SM\"" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\""IPVPN-SM\"" and component=\""MAIN_END\"" and status=\""FAILED\"" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### AppQueryIngestionException\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMAuthException\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\n\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\n\n1. In case we want perform the execution for just **one 5m interval**, we provide the same argument for `reference-start-time` and `reference-end-time` fields. E.g. for 5m period of 18/12/2022 10:10:\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181010\n```\n2. If we want to perform requests for **5 multiple consecutive** 5min intervals E.g. for 5m periods of 18/12/2022 10:10 to 10:30 (inclusive):\n\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181030\n```\nThe logs of this operation are appended to the log files in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`.\n"

What steps are involved in exporting TeMIP alarms from Kudu to Impala?,The `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` Oozie coordinator runs daily at 06:00. It transfers older records from:\n- `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` to `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`\n- `temip.temip_kudu_historic_events` to `temip.temip_impala_historic_events`\nMonitor the workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` through Hue and check logs for errors.,Infrastructure & Deployment,"# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer™ ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\""[ Temip ] No alarms available.\""`\n  - **Body:** `\""There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\""`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n	1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n		We receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n	1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n		- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n		- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n	1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \""temipaharchi.alarmobject0\"" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \""terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\""\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\n\n    Example for day 20220501:\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \""temipaharchi.alarmobject0\"" identifier 30 20230104 \""terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\""\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\n\n        ``` sql\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\n        \""Terminated-Oracle\"" state,\n        \""Closed\"" problem_status,\n        case when clearancereportflag = \""1\"" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\n        handledby as handled_by,\n        closedby as closed_by,\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\n        null previous_state,\n        managedobject as managed_object,\n        targetentities as target_entities,\n        --targetentities60512 as target_entities,\n        alarmtype as alarm_type,\n        eventtime as event_time,\n        probablecause as probable_cause,\n        securityalarmcause as security_alarm_cause,\n        specificproblems as specific_problems,\n        --specificproblems (id)-8eloume to join kai edw,\n        null backed_up_status,\n        backupobject as backup_object,\n        trendindication as trend_indication,\n        thresholdinfo as threshold_info,\n        cast(notificationidentifier as bigint) notification_identifier,\n        correlnotifinfo as correl_notif_info,\n        monitoredattributes as monitored_attributes,\n        proposedrepairactions as proposed_repair_actions,\n        null additional_information,\n        domain as domain,\n        securityalarmdetector as security_Alarm_Detector,\n        null service_User,\n        null service_Provider,\n        ocname as oc_Name,\n        cast(parentalarmobject as bigint) parent_alarm_object,\n        null severity_changed_time_stamp,\n        alarmcomment as alarm_comment,\n        agentalarmidentifier as agent_alarm_identifier,\n        agententity as agent_entity,\n        perceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\n        0 useridentifier,\n        usertext as user_Text,\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\n        null deleted,\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\n        --,*\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\n        ```\n\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \n\n    1.

How are LTE data files for TrustCenter generated and validated?,"The Oozie coordinator `Location_Mobility_2Hour_CO` executes `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh` every 2 hours. It extracts data from `eea.eea_hour`, creates files like `LM_02_lte_yyyyMMdd_000xx.txt`, and uploads them to `/lm` via SFTP. Validation includes checking `/shared/abc/location_mobility/logging/LM_02_lte_reconciliation.log` for the correct file entries and line counts.",Data Management & Query Execution,"# TrustCenter Flows\n\n        This is a document that will assist on support.

If files were missing the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded.  \n        Before manually executing the script in this case, check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log.\n        \n        - If 5 or more files weren't exported execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag.  \n        This will instruct the script to catch-up meaning to export files for N 2-hour intervals.  \n        This is not needed if 4 or less files were missed in which case the procedure will automatically catch up.  \n        For example if 6 files were not exported run:\n        \n            ``` bash\n            /shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh --max-files 6 >> /shared/abc/location_mobility/log/lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1\n            ```\n        \n        - If you need to export files for a specific date execute the script with the `-t <yyyymmdd>` flag.

If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\n\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\n\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```"
How do you manually execute the Cube Indicators pipeline from the terminal?,1. SSH into `un1.bigdata.abc.gr` as `intra` and go to:\n```bash\ncd projects/cube_ind\n```\n2. Fetch latest script:\n```bash\nkinit -kt /home/intra/intra.keytab intra\nhdfs dfs -get /user/intra/cube/Indicators_Spark_Job.py\n```\n3. Edit and run `run_cube.sh` with the correct date:\n```bash\nvim run_cube.sh\n./run_cube.sh\n```,Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution,### Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\n\n1. Connect to `un1.bigdata.abc.gr` and change user to `intra` using sudo.\n\n2. Change directory \n```\ncd projects/cube_ind\n```\n\n3.

Inform the customer about the problem\n\n``` text\nGood evening,\n\nWe see that for the new points you mention there are SLA metrics in the respective tables. These points are excluded when generating the CSV as the probe name does not match what is expected. Specifically:\n\nThe delimeter in the probe name is the \""_\"" character, the device type is extracted from the probe name, and the measurements included in the CSVs are for the device types 'ce', 'ce 1024Bytes', 'cpe', 'cpe 1024Bytes', 'nte', 'nte 1024Bytes'.\n\nΑυτό το probe είναι valid:\navail_saa-csr1_ip-sla-probe_fraport_Frap12_cpe_fraport\nWhile the following belonging to one of the points you mentioned is not:\navail_saa-csr5_ip-sla-probe_fraport_Frap-PVK1_64_ce\nAs you can see in the device type position it has the value 64 and is therefore excluded in the generated CSVs.\n\nPlease correct the probe names. If there is nothing else please let us know so we can close the ticket.\n```\n\n<b>Affected Systems:</b>\n\nabc Bigstreamer CDSW\n\n<b>Action Points:</b>"

These tables seem to fill up throughout the day, so the stats don't appear to be up to date.\nThe statistics refer to data in partitions of previous days.\n\n- In terms of performance, it is not possible to run compute statistics on partitions that continuously receive data during the day.\nThere are streams that load data every 5 minutes.\nDoing so would significantly delay data processing.\n\n- Obviously, the queries that are executed include the current partition and that is why the Warning for missing statistics is displayed.\nAttached you will find an example for sai.sms_raw for different par_dt, in which it appears that for historical data no warning is displayed.\n\nIf statistics are needed for specific tables, we should consider it as a project and not under Support. We should consider how the performance of the cluster is affected and make the right design, so that we can agree on the frequency that the statistics should be calculated.\n\n\n<b>Title :	further actions have also been made </b>"

How are SNMP files transformed and merged in the Piraeus Cisco VDSL2 application?,"After polling SNMP data, the application transforms the files into CSV format and then merges them. The transformation path is configured via `vdsl2.dataDir` and `vdsl2.filePattern` in `/app/conf/application.yaml`. The merging process uses `fmerger.dataDir` and `fmerger.filePattern`. The merged output is named `VDSL2_*.csv` and saved in the pod's work directory.",Application Functionality & Flow,"# PIRAEUS CISCO VDSL2\n\n        ## Useful links\n        \n        - [Piraeus Cisco VDSL2 App](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-app)\n        - [Piraeus Cisco VDSL2 DevOps](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-devops)\n        - [Piraeus Cisco VDSL2 Deployment](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-deployment)\n        - [Wiki Page](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-devops/-/wikis/home)\n        - [File Definitions](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-devops/-/wikis/File-Definitions)\n        - [Monitoring](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/common-dev/apps/monitoring/monitoring-devops/-/wikis/home)\n        - [Deployment Instructions](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-deployment/-/blob/main/Readme.md)\n        \n        ## Overview\n        \n        `Piraeus Cisco Vdsl2 App` is an application that polls data every 5 minutes using SNMP, transforms the SNMPs output files, concatenates the files to one output file and then places it to an SFTP server and an HDFS directory, in order to be retrieved by the customer. The application runs in a Kubernetes pod. [Monitoring App](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/common-dev/apps/monitoring/monitoring-devops/-/wikis/home#prod) is used for monitoring and health checks.\n        \n        **Pod User:** `root`  \n        **Pod Scheduler:** `Cron`  \n        **Kubernetes Namespace** `piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-deployment`  \n        **Cluster User** `ipvpn`  \n        **Container Registry** `kubemaster-vip.bigdata.abc.gr/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-app`  \n        **Schedule:** `Every 5 minutes`  \n        **Pod Script:** `/app/run_vdsl2.sh`  \n        **Main Configuration File:** `/app/conf/application.yaml`  \n        **Logs:** Use `kubectl logs` to view `stdout`  \n        **Hadoop Table:** `bigcust.vdsl2`\n        \n        ## Application Components\n        \n        ### SNMP Polling of Elements\n        \n        ``` mermaid\n          graph TD\n          A[Piraeus Bank VTUs] -->|SNMP Polling| B[File: nnmcp.vdsl-g*.\\*.txt <br> Path: /app/work/data <br> Pod ]\n        ```\n        \n        The application polls data using SNMP.

What should I do if the CSI Redis flow fails during the Spark aggregation step?,"If a Spark job fails during the aggregation step (e.g., AggregateRdCells, CSIAveragePerCellId), the whole flow should stop as per design. You should check the log archive at `/user/rediscsi/log` (e.g., `csiRedis.<partition>.tar.gz`) to identify the failure. Then, re-execute the failed Spark job manually using the corresponding command like:\n\n`spark-submit --class de.telekom.cxi.aggregator.AggregateRdCells cxi-etl-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

How can I troubleshoot a failed IPVPN-SM ingestion request to the SQM server?,"To troubleshoot failed ingestion, first check the logs at `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs`. Then verify the application status using:\n`curl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'`\nEnsure the request format in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml` complies with the schema, and the `/ingest-query` endpoint receives valid data.",Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution,"[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\n\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n\n### Ingestion Endpoint\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`.

Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n\n\n# Support\n\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \""IPVPN-SM\"" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\""IPVPN-SM\"" and component=\""MAIN_END\"" and status=\""FAILED\"" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### AppQueryIngestionException\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMAuthException\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\n\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\n\n1. In case we want perform the execution for just **one 5m interval**, we provide the same argument for `reference-start-time` and `reference-end-time` fields. E.g. for 5m period of 18/12/2022 10:10:\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181010\n```\n2. If we want to perform requests for **5 multiple consecutive** 5min intervals E.g. for 5m periods of 18/12/2022 10:10 to 10:30 (inclusive):\n\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181030\n```\nThe logs of this operation are appended to the log files in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`.\n"

stuck in a deleting state.\n\n![longhornUI](.media/longhornbug.JPG)\n\n<b>Resolution:</b>\nTo resolve the issue and restore the airflow-scheduler pod's functionality, the following steps were taken:\n\nDeletion of Problematic PVC: The three problematic replicas of airflow-scheduler PVC in Longhorn, which were stuck in a deleting state, were the problem, as a result we deleted the airflow's PVC.\nNfgh: It is important to mention that this issue might be related to a bug within the Longhorn storage system, as it caused replicated PVCs to get stuck in a deleting state. Further investigation and monitoring of Longhorn may be necessary to prevent such issues from recurring.

How is replication managed between idm1 and idm2 in the IDM setup?,Replication is performed using GSSAPI Kerberos authentication with push-based propagation. You can check replication with:\n\n```bash\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\n```\n\nTo force sync:\n\n```bash\nipa-replica-manage force-sync --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\n```\n\nTroubleshooting showed that differences in `krbTicketFlags` and `requires_preauth` settings can affect replication.,Application Functionality & Flow,"# Manage IDM Replication\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Setup\n\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \""push\"" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\""KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\""\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \""modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \""modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\""\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\""\""\nipactl restart\n```"
What steps are required to set up connectivity between BigStreamer and Viavi's Kafka for RAN.AI?,The setup uses HAProxy on a single Incelligent node to forward traffic to Viavi Kafka brokers over VLAN 300. Internal DNS is configured to point to the new internal IPs. HAProxy configuration uses TCP mode and TLS (port 9093). Start the service with:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start haproxy\n```\n\nCheck connectivity using `ss -tulnp | grep 9093` and `nc -zv` for each broker.,Application Functionality & Flow,# Manage Connectivity with Viavi Kafka\n\n- [Manage Connectivity with Viavi Kafka](#manage-connectivity-with-viavi-kafka)\n  - [Setup](#setup)\n    - [HAProxy Configuration](#haproxy-configuration)\n  - [Procedure](#procedure)\n    - [Manage HAProxy](#manage-haproxy)\n    - [Manage DNS entries](#manage-dns-entries)\n\n## Setup\n\nIncelligent wants to develop an application with Viavi's Kafka cluster as the datasource.This project aims to replace the current feed that powers RAN.AI Geolocation that is based on SFTP file transfers with a Spark Streaming application.

How were the AppEmptyQueryException alerts for IF and CPU/MEM metrics resolved?,"The alerts were due to missing files from the NNM source system. Logs on `un2` and `nnmprd01` confirmed no CSV files were generated in the affected intervals. No issues were found with the loading or transfer scripts, confirming it was a source issue.",Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution,"# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \""File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\""\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \""No file found.. sleep and try again..\"" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts."

How do you renew Kubernetes certificates in the RANAI cluster?,Run `kubeadm certs renew all` on each master node and replace the config files for both root and incelligent user. Then delete the CoreDNS pods to regenerate them:\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-... -n kube-system\n```\n\nDowntime is required for container restarts.,Infrastructure & Deployment,"# Scope\n\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring. In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \""kube-controller-man…\""   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\n1bd22e95ef01        5a84bb672db8           \""kube-scheduler --au…\""   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-scheduler_kube-scheduler-cti-cx1_kube-system_649aa160f1bd0840b2bb0f70b6493f99_9\ncf43799ae77d0       b6e18ffb844e6          \""kube-apiserver --au…\""   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                 \n```\n\nStop containers IDs:\n\n```bash\nctrctl stop 1350c48cbfb5 1bd22e95ef01 cf3cb7655b99d\n```\n\n> Ndef_1: Keep in mind that when the containers will be stopped, there will be downtime\n\n> Ndef_2: Keep in mind that those pods are static so you don't need to kill them. They will be automatically restarted\n\n- Also delete core-dns pod:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns\nNAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\ncoredns-64897985d-7dzkl   1/1     Running   3 (84d ago)   644d\ncoredns-64897985d-rw5kc   1/1     Running   0             83d\n```\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-64897985d-7dzkl  coredns-64897985d-rw5kc  -n kube-system\n```\n\n- Repeat the same procedure for `kubemaster2` and `kubemaster3`\n\n\n> Ndef: incelligent user exists only at kubemaster1, so you dont have to to do actions for this users at kubemaster2 and kubemaster3"

How do you repair broken MySQL replication due to invalid queries?,On the slave node:\n1. Check status:\n```bash\nSHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n```\n2. Stop slave:\n```bash\nSTOP SLAVE;\n```\n3. Restore from backup:\n```bash\ntar -zxvf /backup/DRBDA_date.tar.gz mysql_backup_date.sql.gz\ngunzip mysql_backup_date.sql.gz\nmysql -uroot -p < mysql_backup_date.sql\n```\n4. Start slave and verify:\n```bash\nSTART SLAVE;\nSHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n```,Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution,"# Fix Mysql Replication\n\n## Scope\n\nSometimes there are invalid MySQL queries which cause the replication to not work anymore. In this short guide, it explained how you can repair the replication on the MySQL slave. This guide is for MySQL.\n\n### Glossary\n\n- MYSQL replication: It is a process that enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to copied automatically to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)\n\n## Setup\n\n### Mysql Instances\n\n#### PR\n\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n\n**User**: `mysql`\n\n**Port**: `3306`\n\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n\n#### DR\n\n**User**: `mysql`\n\n**Port**: `3306`\n\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n**Master Mysql Host**: `dr1node03.mno.gr`\n\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `dr1node02.mno.gr`\n\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Identify the problem\n\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n      ```\n\n2. If one of `Slave_IO_Running` or `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`, then the replication is broken\n\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n	STOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n	\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n	\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n	- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n      tar -ztvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz | grep -i mysql_backup # List contents of the tar.gz file.Under backup folder stored tar.gz files from daily backup procedure,for both sites, with the format CLUSTER_year-month-day.tar.gz (e.g DRBDA_2022-03-21.tar.gz). This files contains several gz files combined in a tar.gz. Now we need to find the exact name of the gz backup file for mysql backup to proceed at next step.\n      tar -zxvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz # Untar from the tar.gz file the exact gz backup file for mysql backup that found from previous step. The exaxt name would be placed on mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz possition\n      gunzip mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz # Decompress the file that untared from previous step\n      mysql -uroot -p < mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql\n      ```\n\n3. After succesfully restoration on **Slave Mysql Host** start slave:\n\n      ``` bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n      - No error should exist on `Last_Error`\n      - If no error appeared then `START SLAVE`\n\n      ```bash\n      START SLAVE;\n      ```\n	  \n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n	- Both Slave_IO_Running and Slave_SQL_Running are set to `Yes` now. And the replication is running without any error.\n	- `Seconds_Behind_Master` should be 0 after some minutes"

Usually only one site is active (Primary Site).\n        \n        ```mermaid\n          graph TD\n          A[Internet Banking Backend Servers] -->|HTTP Requests| B[Load Balancer - Netscaler]\n          B -->|Active| C[pr1edge01.mno.gr]\n          B -->|Active| D[pr1edge02.mno.gr]\n          B -.->|Stopped| E[dr1edge01.mno.gr]\n          B -.->|Stopped| F[dr1edge02.mno.gr]\n          C -->|Kafka Producer| G[Primary Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n          D -->|Kafka Producer| G\n          E -.->|Stopped| H[Disaster Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n          F -.->|Stopped| H\n        ```\n        \n        **User**: `PRODREST`\n        \n        **Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib`\n        \n        **Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/deployments`\n        \n        **General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n        \n        **Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodrestib/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiIBankJmxConfig.xml`\n        \n        **Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/server.log`\n        \n        **Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`\n        \n        **Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_wildfly.md)\n        \n        **Instructions for migrating traffic to DR site**: [Here](../procedures/failover.md)\n        \n        **Alerts**:\n        \n        - [PR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n        - [DR][IBANK] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n        - [PR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n        - [DR][IBANK] Ingestion Average Error rate\n        \n        **Troubleshooting Steps**:\n        \n        - Check application logs for error messages.\n        - In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\n        - If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Kafka performance.\n        \n        ### Kafka Mirrorring\n        \n        After being published to Kafka, the traffic is mirrored to the opposite site via Kafka MirrorMaker. In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n        \n        #### PR replication\n        \n        ```mermaid\n          graph TD\n          A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n          B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n          D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n          E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n          C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n          F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n        \n        ```\n        \n        #### DR replication\n        \n        ``` mermaid\n          graph TD\n          A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n          B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n          D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream-mir]\n          E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n          F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n          C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream]\n        ```\n        \n        **MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n        \n        **Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n        \n        **Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n        \n        **Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n        \n        **Alerts**:\n        \n        - Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n        \n        ### Spark Streaming\n        \n        After being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\n        \n        #### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream\n        \n        This topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.

Start `prodreston` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n        \n        3. Ask for a mno Network administrator to make a call.\n           \n        4. Ask them to enable the new servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to enable as explained [here](manage_wildfly.md#consolidated-network-information)).\n           \n        5. Check logs for both Wildfly instances at both servers to ensure everything works.\n           \n        6. When you are certain everything is OK, ask the mno Network administrators to disable the prexisting servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to disable).\n           \n        7. From the access logs of the prexisting Wildfly instances check that no traffic is received. \n           \n        8. Stop these Wildfly instances as described in the procedures [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib) and [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n        \n        ### Migrate UC4 flows between PR/DR\n        \n        1. Login to the edge servers of the active and passive site using your personal account and become `root`.\n        \n        2. Stop UC4 agent at the edge nodes of the active site.\n           \n          ``` bash\n          systemctl stop uc4agent\n          ```\n        \n        3. Start service for UC4 agent at the edge servers of the passive site.\n        \n          ``` bash\n          systemctl start uc4agent\n          ```\n        \n        4.

Migrate the creation of trigger files for external jobs\n        \n          - On the active site:\n        \n            ``` bash\n            vi /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_STABLE_v2.sh\n            # Comment the followin lines along with the assosiated checks\n            # touch /home/bank_central_mno_gr/datawarehouse_status/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n            # touch /opt/applications/landing_zone/PRODUSER/triggers/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n            ```  \n          - On the passive site:\n        \n            ``` bash\n            vi /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_STABLE_v2.sh\n            # Uncomment the followin lines along with the assosiated checks\n            # touch /home/bank_central_mno_gr/datawarehouse_status/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n            # touch /opt/applications/landing_zone/PRODUSER/triggers/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n            ```  "
How do you troubleshoot a failed UC4 job for DWH_IBank EXTRACT TRANSFER?,"Check UC4 log `/var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log` and Spark logs via YARN UI. If the issue is resolved and UC4 does not auto-retry, rerun manually:\n\n```bash\n# For previous day\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t transfer\n\n# For specific day\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t transfer -p 20230411\n```",Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution,"# Datawarehouse ibank\n\n        ## Extract\n        \n        **Extraction of detail tables**\n        \n        Our spark application will extract information from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table to different detail tables based on different service names with the help of lookup table service_name where needed. The columns of the detail tables are produced either from a non json column of the input table (eg. client_username) or from parsing the json fields request_text_data and response_text_data and extracting specific fields based on their name. When two fields have the same name then we will keep the greater value either for a number field or for a string based on lexicographic order.\n        These jobs are executed by the bank's scheduler.

What is the procedure to commit MirrorMaker consumer group offsets to prevent reprocessing after downtime?,"1. Ensure consumers are inactive\n2. Create `group.properties` and `jaas.conf`\n3. Login as `kafka@BDAP.mno.GR` and export config:\n```bash\nkinit kafka@BDAP.mno.GR\nexport KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS=\""-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./jaas.conf\""\n```\n4. Execute:\n```bash\nkafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server ... --group mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001 --reset-offsets --to-datetime 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z --execute\n```",Infrastructure & Deployment,"# Manage Kafka MirrorMaker\n\n## Scope\n\nKafka MirrorMaker has been configured with auto.offsets.reset=false. This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node01 and pr1node04:\n\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n2. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06:\n  \n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n3. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node01 and dr1node04:\n\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n4. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node05 and dr1node06:\n  \n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Stop Kafka MirrorMakers for PR site\n\n1. Stop Primary Site MirrorMakers:\n\n    From the Primary Site Cloudera Manager with a user that has administrator privileges:\n\n    - PRBDA > Kafka > Instances\n    - Select the MirrorMakers running on nodes pr1node01,pr1node04,pr1node05 and pr1node06\n    - Stop\n\n2. Stop Disaster Site MirrorMakers:\n\n    From the Disaster Site Cloudera Manager with a user that has administrator privileges:\n\n    - DRBDA > Kafka > Instances\n    - Select the MirrorMakers running on nodes dr1node05 and dr1node06\n    - Stop\n\n### Stop Kafka MirrorMakers for DR site\n\n1. Stop Primary Site MirrorMakers:\n\n    From the Primary Site Cloudera Manager with a user that has administrator privileges:\n\n    - DRBDA > Kafka > Instances\n    - Select the MirrorMakers running on nodes dr1node01,dr1node04,dr1node05 and dr1node06\n    - Stop\n\n2. Stop Disaster Site MirrorMakers:\n\n    From the Disaster Site Cloudera Manager with a user that has administrator privileges:\n\n    - PRBDA > Kafka > Instances\n    - Select the MirrorMakers running on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06\n    - Stop\n\n### Commit Consumer Groups Offsets for PR site\n\nThe following steps can be performed at any node of the Primary Site cluster.

How can you validate signed TLS certificates before deploying them to HAProxy edge nodes?,1. Check subject and modulus:\n```bash\nopenssl req -in cert.req -noout -text\nopenssl req -in cert.req -noout -text -modulus\nopenssl rsa -in node.key -noout -text -modulus\n```\n2. Check issuer:\n```bash\nfor i in *.crt; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep issuer; done\n```\n3.

Login to Cloudera Manager in DR and check the alarm\n2. It was a block count alarm on `dr1node09`\n3. Login to `dr1edge01` with your personal account and execute `firefox` to view the Namenode UI.\n4. Go to `https://dr1node02.mno.gr:50470` and from there in the tab `Datanodes`. Order the datanodes using the block count by desceding order to overview the situation.\n5. Change user to PRODREST and use HDFS command or Impala query to check how many partitions exist in `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. This is a big table that has no retention mechanism yet so its data are stored in many blocks. HDFS command is `hdfs dfs -ls /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old` and Impala query is `show partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. In either case observe how many `par_dt` directories exist.\n6. In our case there were at least 6 months in there so we informed mno. Example mail:\n```\nGood evening,\nRegarding ticket SD1734269, the error shown in Cloudera Manager refers to a block count threshold exceeded on dr1node09 and is due to the increased number of blocks stored on the new nodes dr1node07-10. The impact on the datanode lies in the performance as the metadata for the blocks it has in memory does not fit.\nFrom the investigation we did in the HDFS data, we saw that there are many files in the prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old table. Specifically, there is history in it from 01/03.\nBy keeping only recent data through a retention mechanism, the total block count in HDFS and on each datanode individually will be reduced.\nAs an immediate solution, we suggest deleting data older than 40 days, as has been done in the past. Consequently, it will not be possible to investigate problems that occurred older than 40 days.\nPlease let us know if you agree with the above and when you would like us to proceed with the immediate solution.\nThank you,\n```\n	Recipients are `ZEVGAROPOULOU.GEORGIA@mno.gr,krekoukias.konst@mno.gr,papakostas.athanasios@mno.gr`.
