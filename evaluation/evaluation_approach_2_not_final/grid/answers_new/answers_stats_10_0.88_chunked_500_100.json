After the restart the alert disappeared.\\n6. During further investigation, from Cloudera UI we saw that prior to ```Process Status``` alert there was a ```NODE_MANAGER_LOG_FREE_SPACE``` alert\\n7. From pr1node01 as root `df -h /`. The usage of `/` was at 98% at that time\\n8. Upon inspection we noticed that the krb5kdc logs had increased over the last months peaking the monthly log file to ~80G.\\n9. We proceeded to the removal of krb5kdc log files for 2022.\\n10. As a permanent solution, we implemented changes to retention policy for krb5kdc logs. Specifically, we changed the rotation to weekly from monthly and the storage to 7 old logs from 12 logs files that it was prior the change.  This change was implemented at pr1node02, dr1node01 and dr1node02 as well.\\n\\n\\n    ![logrotate_krb5kdc](.media/IM2095156/IM2095156_logrotate_krb5kdc.PNG)\\n\\n<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>\\n\\n```\\n09/03/23 15:47:41 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\\nGood evening,\\n\\nFollowing the investigation, we have changed the retention for krb5kdc logs.

The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\\n\\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\\n\\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\\n\\nIf you need further information we can arrange a call.\\n\\nG.

Login to DR/PR edge nodes and through the node's firefox check YARN at https://dr1node03:8090 and https://pr1node03:8090 for the PROD_Ibank merge batch job.\\n3. Check the stages tab for stages that have been completed for this job. At PR the `insert into` stages had completed after 8h. The RDD stages had failed and continued failing.\\n![Yarn UI](.media/IM2285747_1.png)\\n![Spark Stages](.media/IM2285747_2.png)\\n4. The 8 hour mark gives us some clues as to the failure. In essence after 8 hours kerberos tickets are dropped, leading to continuous authentication failures and timeouts as shown in the logs `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log`.\\n5. Checked the merge batch logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_v2.log` and `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log` and indeed we found authorization errors.\\n6. Checked the size and count of the `service_audit_old` table through Impala and HDFS and it was found to be among the largest ever both in size (over 115 GB) and count (60 mil). The query used is `select  count(*) from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old where par_dt=20240229`.\\n7. Inspecting the submition script we can see that for each individual sub-script the date is generated anew in the sub-script invocation. This means that since the merge in question spanned multiple dates, all steps started after the day's end wouldn't have completed succesfully.\\n8. Inspecting the range partitions through Impala with the query `show range partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream`, we can find multiple leftover range partitions since November. This added further computation time for the already large table.\\n\\nInvestigation for 05/03:\\n\\nFor this day, while the size and count were not unusually large the last step of the process, ie. the\\nhbase upsert took unusually long and couldn't complete on its own. The process seemed to get stuck on 1\\nsingular task as shown by the logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log`, which leads us to conclude that a certain record was problematic because all tasks completed\\nnormally except a specific one that kept failling even on re-runs.\\n\\nInvestigation - Summary:\\n\\n- Greater than most end of the month dates size(over 115 GB) and count (60 mil)\\n- Multiple leftover range partitions\\n- Execution spanning multiple days, triggering the dynamic date issue with the submition script\\n- Stage execution surpassing the 8 hour mark, triggering a known kerberos authorization bug\\n- Problematic record for 05/03\\n\\n<b>Resolution:</b>\\n\\n1. Since the data was already loaded into PR for 29/2, the rest of the steps were executed manually on it\\n   according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#batch instructions for\\n   steps beyond the Merge Batch .\\n2. For all the remaining dates since 29/2 and because the cron jobs were stopped, each day was executed\\n   manually in full in each site, half of them (days) in PR and half of them (days) in DR following\\n   all the steps in the sub-steps guide from https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md .\\n3. For each job completed in one site it was replicated over to the other using HDFS replication, through\\n   the destination's Cloudera Manager for both `service_audit` and `service_audit_old` tables. **A similar\\n   procedure for table replication exists in [Table Replication](./20201218-IM1389913.md) but not for HDFS replication.**\\n   - /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old/par_dt=$date\\n   - /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit/par_dt=$date\\n4. Once replicated the HBase Upsert step was run on the destination site according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\\n5. HBase markers were manually set for each job that didn't complete automatically according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\\n6. Kudu range partitions were cleaned up manually for all previous days and 3 new partitions were created\\n   for the 3 previous days, in order for the cleanup script to continue functioning as nornal. More details\\n   on this can be found at the end of this document.\\n\\n\\nResolution for 05/03 HBase Upsert:\\n\\nFor this operation specifically more resources had to be allocated to the spark-submit job at `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert/submitVisibleTrnToHbaseIndexesDailyUpsert_STABLE.sh`. After its completion resources were reverted back to normal:\\n```\\nIncrease node count to 12\\nDecrease core count to 1\\nIncrease tasks to 40\\n```\\n\\nKudu Range Partitions:\\n\\nRange partitions are created for the `service_audit_stream` table on the `u_timestamp` column. The commands to create and delete them\\ncan be found below for some example dates. Ndef that those partitions are in UTC time, so the time to\\ncreate/drop must be converted to local time, taking into account DST. For winter we are at GMT+2 so in order\\nto include a full day it must range for 22:00 of the previous to 22:00 of the current (where current is the day you want to delete).\\n\\n```sh\\n# Drop\\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream drop range partition '2023-02-26T22:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-27T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\\n\\n# Create\\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream add range partition '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-28T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\\n```\\n\\nThe example above includes the first partition, which tracks from 1970 to the date in question. When deleting previous partitions, the first one\\nmust be recreated in order to include the time from 1970 to the first date, and then you can create the daily partitions.
