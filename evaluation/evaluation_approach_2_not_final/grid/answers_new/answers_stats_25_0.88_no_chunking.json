Ssh pr1node01 and inspect logs at /var/loh/hadoop-yarn. We could not find the root cause from logs\\n5. Restart the Node Manager role for the specific node. After the restart the alert disappeared.\\n6. During further investigation, from Cloudera UI we saw that prior to ```Process Status``` alert there was a ```NODE_MANAGER_LOG_FREE_SPACE``` alert\\n7. From pr1node01 as root `df -h /`. The usage of `/` was at 98% at that time\\n8. Upon inspection we noticed that the krb5kdc logs had increased over the last months peaking the monthly log file to ~80G.\\n9. We proceeded to the removal of krb5kdc log files for 2022.\\n10. As a permanent solution, we implemented changes to retention policy for krb5kdc logs. Specifically, we changed the rotation to weekly from monthly and the storage to 7 old logs from 12 logs files that it was prior the change.  This change was implemented at pr1node02, dr1node01 and dr1node02 as well.\\n\\n\\n    ![logrotate_krb5kdc](.media/IM2095156/IM2095156_logrotate_krb5kdc.PNG)\\n\\n<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>\\n\\n```\\n09/03/23 15:47:41 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\\nGood evening,\\n\\nFollowing the investigation, we have changed the retention for krb5kdc logs.

The `Upsert to HBase` stage that synchronises the `Visible` table caused an Impala problem during which Impala stopped to process this job as well as other requests.\\n5. The problem is described below.\\n\\n<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>\\n\\n```\\n03/03/23 11:17:49 Europe/Eastern (POULAS GIORGOS):\\nAfter investigating yesterday's Impala issue, we found the following:\\n\\nDue to HBase quotas set in the PROD_IBANK namespace, we have limited the parallelism in the Impala query to run on an Impala daemon.\\n\\nThe daemon that ran the query to enrich the Service Audit Visible (pr1node04) encountered a problem as it did not have the resources required to process the large volume of records we had at the end of the month, while at the same time accepting requests from the REST APIs of the live streams.\\n\\nAs a result of the above, the queries from the live systems were not completing and accumulating, exhausting the available connections that Impala can accept. The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\\n\\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\\n\\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\\n\\nIf you need further information we can arrange a call.\\n\\nG.

The dublicate key value is (e5435435-4354254235-121nfdgd33)`\\n\\n\\nThat means that the table already has records in it, so we have to drop this records or invoke the script with the `-f` option that gives the ability to trancate the table and then insert the records. \\n\\n```\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t manDate -f\\n```\\n\\nAfter executing the extract script, we use the same `-f` to run the export script.

It seems to be still running. We have disabled it on 1/31 until this is finished.\\n\\nThanks,\\nThanos\\n```\\n\\n<b>Investigation:</b>\\n\\n**Ndef**: All log paths and query executions are found/executed from pr1edge01/dr1edge01.\\n\\n1. Login to Grafana and make sure that the failed step is the Merge Batch.\\n2. Login to DR/PR edge nodes and through the node's firefox check YARN at https://dr1node03:8090 and https://pr1node03:8090 for the PROD_Ibank merge batch job.\\n3. Check the stages tab for stages that have been completed for this job. At PR the `insert into` stages had completed after 8h. The RDD stages had failed and continued failing.\\n![Yarn UI](.media/IM2285747_1.png)\\n![Spark Stages](.media/IM2285747_2.png)\\n4. The 8 hour mark gives us some clues as to the failure. In essence after 8 hours kerberos tickets are dropped, leading to continuous authentication failures and timeouts as shown in the logs `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log`.\\n5. Checked the merge batch logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_v2.log` and `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log` and indeed we found authorization errors.\\n6. Checked the size and count of the `service_audit_old` table through Impala and HDFS and it was found to be among the largest ever both in size (over 115 GB) and count (60 mil). The query used is `select  count(*) from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old where par_dt=20240229`.\\n7. Inspecting the submition script we can see that for each individual sub-script the date is generated anew in the sub-script invocation. This means that since the merge in question spanned multiple dates, all steps started after the day's end wouldn't have completed succesfully.\\n8. Inspecting the range partitions through Impala with the query `show range partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream`, we can find multiple leftover range partitions since November. This added further computation time for the already large table.\\n\\nInvestigation for 05/03:\\n\\nFor this day, while the size and count were not unusually large the last step of the process, ie. the\\nhbase upsert took unusually long and couldn't complete on its own. The process seemed to get stuck on 1\\nsingular task as shown by the logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log`, which leads us to conclude that a certain record was problematic because all tasks completed\\nnormally except a specific one that kept failling even on re-runs.\\n\\nInvestigation - Summary:\\n\\n- Greater than most end of the month dates size(over 115 GB) and count (60 mil)\\n- Multiple leftover range partitions\\n- Execution spanning multiple days, triggering the dynamic date issue with the submition script\\n- Stage execution surpassing the 8 hour mark, triggering a known kerberos authorization bug\\n- Problematic record for 05/03\\n\\n<b>Resolution:</b>\\n\\n1. Since the data was already loaded into PR for 29/2, the rest of the steps were executed manually on it\\n   according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#batch instructions for\\n   steps beyond the Merge Batch .\\n2. For all the remaining dates since 29/2 and because the cron jobs were stopped, each day was executed\\n   manually in full in each site, half of them (days) in PR and half of them (days) in DR following\\n   all the steps in the sub-steps guide from https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md .\\n3. For each job completed in one site it was replicated over to the other using HDFS replication, through\\n   the destination's Cloudera Manager for both `service_audit` and `service_audit_old` tables. **A similar\\n   procedure for table replication exists in [Table Replication](./20201218-IM1389913.md) but not for HDFS replication.**\\n   - /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old/par_dt=$date\\n   - /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit/par_dt=$date\\n4. Once replicated the HBase Upsert step was run on the destination site according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\\n5. HBase markers were manually set for each job that didn't complete automatically according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\\n6. Kudu range partitions were cleaned up manually for all previous days and 3 new partitions were created\\n   for the 3 previous days, in order for the cleanup script to continue functioning as nornal. More details\\n   on this can be found at the end of this document.\\n\\n\\nResolution for 05/03 HBase Upsert:\\n\\nFor this operation specifically more resources had to be allocated to the spark-submit job at `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert/submitVisibleTrnToHbaseIndexesDailyUpsert_STABLE.sh`. After its completion resources were reverted back to normal:\\n```\\nIncrease node count to 12\\nDecrease core count to 1\\nIncrease tasks to 40\\n```\\n\\nKudu Range Partitions:\\n\\nRange partitions are created for the `service_audit_stream` table on the `u_timestamp` column. The commands to create and delete them\\ncan be found below for some example dates. Ndef that those partitions are in UTC time, so the time to\\ncreate/drop must be converted to local time, taking into account DST. For winter we are at GMT+2 so in order\\nto include a full day it must range for 22:00 of the previous to 22:00 of the current (where current is the day you want to delete).\\n\\n```sh\\n# Drop\\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream drop range partition '2023-02-26T22:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-27T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\\n\\n# Create\\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream add range partition '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-28T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\\n```\\n\\nThe example above includes the first partition, which tracks from 1970 to the date in question. When deleting previous partitions, the first one\\nmust be recreated in order to include the time from 1970 to the first date, and then you can create the daily partitions.

Ensure that the new disk is properly installed, configured, and recognized by the operating system.\n\n4. **Reformat the new disk**: Reformat the new disk to ensure it is properly prepared for use in HDFS.\n\n5. **Recommission the DataNode**: Recommission the DataNode (dr1node02) back into the HDFS cluster. This step re-integrates the DataNode into the cluster's topology, allowing it to once again receive and store data blocks.\n\n6. **Verify cluster health**: After recommissioning the DataNode, verify that the HDFS cluster is healthy and functioning correctly. Check for any errors, warnings, or inconsistencies in the cluster's logs and metrics.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively handle and recover from a failed disk replacement on a DataNode in HDFS.",
        "retrieved_context": "# InfiniBand Replacement\n\nReplacing an IB card require powering off the host. Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n\n## Decommission\n\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary. From it, check for any custom, non-default IP partitions.\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# sminfo\nsminfo: sm lid 15 sm guid 0x10e0406d5aa0a0, activity count 26263191 priority 14 state 3 SMINFO_MASTER\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ibnetdiscover | grep 10e0406d5aa0a0\nswitchguid=0x10e0406d5aa0a0(10e0406d5aa0a0)\nSwitch 36 \"S-0010e0406d5aa0a0\" # \"SUN DCS 36P QDR bdax01sw-ib1 xxx.xxx.171.24\" enhanced port 0 lid 15 lmc 0\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ssh root@xxx.xxx.171.24\n\n[root@bda01sw-ib1 ~]# smpartition list active\n# Sun DCS IB partition config file\n# This file is generated, do not edit\n#! version_number : 0\nDefault=0x7fff, ipoib : ALL_CAS=full, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full;\nSUN_DCS=0x0001, ipoib : ALL_SWITCHES=full;\n\nIf there are IB partitions other than default partitions, then refer to MOS ndef 1985159.1 for additional steps that will need to be taken before the old HCA is removed.\n```\n- [MOS ndef 1985159.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=SrDetailText&sourceId=3-37179888534&id=1985159.1)\n\nIf `smpartition list active` shows output similar to the above, no actions are needed.

If\nthe interfaces are non-routable, as is the case for bondeth1 and bondeth2, these options must be removed.\n\n1. Check for any interfaces that should not be in the DOWN state with `ip a`\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove\n   any option not present in the known-good node.

Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n\n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n\n## Pollaploi Flow\n\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**",

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n\n## Hbase table creation\n\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n- Set throttle quotas of type 'read'\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'read'\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_read_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => WRITE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n-  Delete and recreate table to repeat to run tests with write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    n_splits = 300\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'write'\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_write_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/hbase2\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads\n\nhttps://blog.cloudera.com/hbase-performance-testing-using-ycsb/\n### Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\n\n1.

For example check if they had the same ammount of `users` and `groups` with `ldapsearch` commands from checks\n\nFrom the `kerb` ldap instance without corruption :\n\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0  config.ldif\nslapcat -n 1 data.ldif\n\nscp *.ldif `ldap_instance_with_corruption`:/tmp\n```\nGo to corrupted `kerb` instance:\n\nBackup:\n```bash\ncp -rp /etc/openldap/ /tmp/openldap.bak\ncp -rp /var/lib/ldap/ /tmp\n```\n\nClear:\n```bash\nsystemctl stop slapd\nsystemctl status slapd\ncd /etc/openldap/\nrm \u2013Rf slapd.d\ncd /etc/openldap\nmkdir slapd.d\ncd /var/lib/ldap/\nrm \u2013Rf *\n```\nRestore:\n```bash\nslapadd -n 0 -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -l /tmp/config.ldif\nslapadd -n 2 -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -l /tmp/data.ldif -w\n```\nOwnership:\n```bash\nchown -R ldap:ldap /var/lib/ldap\n```\nStart `slapd` service:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start slapd\nsystemctl status slapd\n```\n\nChecks:\n\nCreate a new user on ldap kerb1 via `UI` with name `testuser`:\n\nThe procedure to create a new user described [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/openldap_change_manager_password.md)\n\nLogin into admin node as root:\n\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: (https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/)\n\nAfter succesfully creation of `testuser` check if exist on `kerb2` from the dropdown menu or via ldapsearch\n\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=testuser'\n```\n\nIf user exist then replication fixed. Just delete the `testuser`.\n\nThe procedure to delete a new user described [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/openldap_change_manager_password.md)\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\n\nServer:\n\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nUseful info:\n\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n\n### Update configuration\n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\n\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n\n3. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n# abc - [One Domain] SpagoBI integration with GROUPNET\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users.\n\nServer to use: PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nProd Server: un5.bigdata.abc.gr\nURL: https://cne.def.gr/SpagoBI\n999.999.999.999 cne.def.gr cne\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf it is not been imported, you should import them using formula  `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain so we can verify that the change is succesfully made. \nVaggos username in our case (enomikos)\n3. Customer should also send a bind user that we will use for groupnet domain configuration.\n4. `/etc/hosts` file at `un5` must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n5. Perfom an ldap search for the given bind user. \n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=enomikos)'\n```\n\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Backup spagobi mysql database:\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysqldump -u root -p spagobi --single-transaction > /tmp/spagobi.sql\n```\n\n2. Back up `ldap_authorizations.xml`:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# cp -ap /usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations.xml /usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations-central.xml\n```\n\n3. Back up haproxy:\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.bak\n```\n\n\n### Actions \n\n1. Login to `https://cne.def.gr/SpagoBI` with the credentials you have and create groupnet user for user `enomikos`:\n- User Management\n- Click on **Add**\n- Fill in with the user ID and full name\n- Add roles\n- Save\n\n2. Verify that the user is successfully created using following commands:\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u spagobi -p;\nmysql> use spagobi;\nmysql> show tables;\nmysql> select * FROM SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID='enomikos@groupnet';\n```\n\n3. Stop SpagoBI process:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# docker stop prod-spagobi-7.0.105\n```\n\n4. Edit the following lines at `un5:/usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations.xml`:\n\n```bash\n<!--  SERVER -->\n                <HOST>un1.bigdata.abc.gr</HOST>\n                <PORT>863</PORT>        \n                <ADMIN_USER>replace_with_name_of_admin</ADMIN_USER>\n                <ADMIN_PSW>replace_with_password</ADMIN_PSW> <!-- password in clear text -->\n                <BASE_DN>dc=groupnet,dc=gr</BASE_DN> <!-- base domain, if any -->\n```\n\n5. Update reverse proxy at `un1` so that Groupnet AD can be reached directly from spagobi app.\n\nAdd the following at `un1:/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`\n\n```bash\nlisten def-ad-ldaps\n    bind *:863 ssl crt /opt/security/haproxy/node.pem\n    mode tcp\n    balance     source\n    server def_ad1 PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636 ssl check ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\n```\n\n6. Test and reload haproxy in order changes to take effect\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -c\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl reload haproxy\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl status haproxy\n```\n\n7. Start SpagoBI app:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# docker start prod-spagobi-7.0.105\n```\n\n8. Check if `enomikos` can sign in. If yes, then go to the next step\n9. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\nmysql> use spagobi;\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%'; #check existing users that belong to central-domain\nUPDATE SBI_USER SET USER_ID = REPLACE(USER_ID,'@central-domain','@groupnet') WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%';\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%'; #check that no user left to central-domain\n```\n\n> Ndef: Before moving all users at once to the new domain you can first test just one. For example:\nUPDATE SBI_USER SET USER_ID = REPLACE(USER_ID,'@groupnet.gr','@groupnet') WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%enomikos@groupnet.gr%'\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%enomikos@groupnet.gr%'\n\n**Congrats!**\n# Manage IDM Replication\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Setup\n\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log",
