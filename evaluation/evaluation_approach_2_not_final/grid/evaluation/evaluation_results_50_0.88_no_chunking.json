        "chatbot_answer": " The correct procedure to resolve a failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the cause of failure**: Use the UC4 agent script logs and sqoop logs to identify the cause of the failure, which in this case is a duplicate key in the loan payment data.\n\n2. **Resolve the duplicate key issue**: Take necessary steps to resolve the duplicate key issue in the loan payment data. This may involve updating or deleting the duplicate records.\n\n3. **Communicate with MNO UC4 administrators**: Once the duplicate key issue has been resolved, communicate with the MNO UC4 administrators to request that they rerun the failed EXPORT job.\n\n4. **Rerun the failed EXPORT job**: If the MNO UC4 administrators agree to rerun the failed EXPORT job, provide them with the necessary information and scripts to rerun the job successfully.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To rerun a failed Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank, you can use the script `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_STABLE_v2.sh`. This script is used to rerun the Merge Batch job for a specific date.\n\nThe reason why it's done in patches is to avoid overloading the system and to ensure that the data is processed correctly. By running the script in patches, you can process the data for a specific date range without overwhelming the system.\n\nIt's also important to note that before rerunning the Merge Batch job, you should check the logs to identify the cause of the failure and ensure that the issue has been resolved. Additionally, you should also check the data in the `service_audit` table to ensure that it is correct and up-to-date. \n\nIn case the merge batch failed after deleting transactions from kudu, or when moving a service_audit partition from DR to PR or vice versa, you should follow the troubleshooting steps outlined in the documentation to resolve the issue.\n\nOverall, rerunning a failed Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank requires careful planning and execution to ensure that the data is processed correctly and efficiently. \n\nPlease let me know if I can assist further. \nI am here to help with any questions or concerns you may have. \n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to assisting you further.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your AI Assistant Name] \n\nNote: The response provided is based on the context given and may not be applicable in all scenarios.

This could involve batching updates, using more efficient data types, or leveraging Impala's built-in optimization features.\n\n3. **Implement Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry mechanisms in your Impala job to handle transient failures that may occur due to concurrency issues or quota limitations.\n\n4. **Consider Horizontal Scaling**: If the concurrency issues persist despite optimizations and retry mechanisms, consider horizontally scaling your HBase cluster to increase its capacity to handle concurrent upsert operations.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase'.    ```bash\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => WRITE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '1000req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Run performance tests with write quotas\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n## Remove write quotas and set read quotas\n- Remove write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '500req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Remove HBase quotas from a namespace\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n   ```bash\n   cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\n   ls \u2013ltr HBASE\n   cd <latest hbase process folder>\n   kinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n   ```\n3.

This involves recognizing that when multiple Impala queries are executed concurrently, they may contend for resources such as memory and CPU, potentially leading to performance degradation or even failures.\n\n2. **Identifying the Role of HBase Quotas**: The next step is to identify how HBase quotas can impact these concurrency issues. HBase quotas can limit the amount of data that can be read or written within a certain time frame. If these quotas are set too low, they can exacerbate concurrency issues by further limiting the resources available to Impala queries.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Impact of Upsert Operations**: Another crucial step is to analyze how upsert operations in Impala can specifically contribute to concurrency issues in relation to HBase quotas. Upsert operations involve inserting new data into a table while also updating existing data if it matches certain conditions. These operations can be particularly resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex update conditions.\n\n4. **Developing Strategies for Mitigation**: Finally, the last step involves developing strategies for mitigating these concurrency issues in relation to HBase quotas. This could involve optimizing upsert operations to reduce their resource intensity, implementing retry mechanisms to handle transient failures, or adjusting HBase quotas to better match the needs of Impala queries.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{To resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase', you can consider the following steps: Monitor and adjust quotas, optimize upsert operations, implement retry mechanisms, and consider horizontal scaling.}$    ```bash\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '500req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Remove HBase quotas from a namespace\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n   ```bash\n   cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\n   ls \u2013ltr HBASE\n   cd <latest hbase process folder>\n   kinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n   ```\n3.

This approach allows you to process smaller chunks of data, reducing the load on Kudu and minimizing the likelihood of scan timeouts. Additionally, you can also adjust the values in the submit script to optimize the performance of the Spark job. \n\nFor example, you can run the following command to process data for a specific time range:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2019-11-09 00:00:00\" \"2019-11-09 12:00:00\"\n```\nBy processing smaller chunks of data, you can reduce the load on Kudu and minimize the likelihood of scan timeouts. \n\nAdditionally, you can also adjust the values in the submit script to optimize the performance of the Spark job. For example, you can increase the number of executors or the amount of memory allocated to each executor. \n\nBy optimizing the performance of the Spark job and reducing the load on Kudu, you can minimize the likelihood of scan timeouts and ensure that your data is processed efficiently and reliably. \n\nIt's also important to monitor the performance of your Spark jobs and Kudu cluster, and to adjust your configuration and optimization strategies as needed to ensure optimal performance and reliability. \n\nIn summary, to reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs, you can consider running the MergeBatch for parts of the day, adjusting the values in the submit script to optimize the performance of the Spark job, and monitoring the performance of your Spark jobs and Kudu cluster to adjust your configuration and optimization strategies as needed. \n\nBy following these strategies, you can minimize the likelihood of scan timeouts and ensure that your data is processed efficiently and reliably. \n\nIt's also important to note that the specific strategies and optimizations that are most effective will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your use case, as well as the characteristics and performance of your Spark jobs and Kudu cluster. \n\nTherefore, it's recommended to carefully evaluate and test different strategies and optimizations

These files are then parsed by one or more procedures. Finally they are loaded to BigStreamer cluster in Impala tables. There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files",

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check IPVPN-SM script and app [logs](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ipvpn_sm_replacement.md#logs)\n##### Load interface_metrics\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Impala Table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist]\n  B[Computation of IF KPIs]\n  C[Impala Table: bigcust.interface_metrics]\n  A -->|Query|B\n  B -->|Load|C\n```\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Impala Table**: `bigcust.interface_metrics`\n#### Inspect specific metric request\nIn case of alerts, we should first check the status of the particular requests on the monitoring DB.\nUsing the metric category and the reference interval associated with a request to IPVPN-SM App we can query the Monitoring DB\nby passing the corresponding job and operative_partition values.\n3.

        "ground_truth": "The Oozie coordinator `Location_Mobility_2Hour_CO` executes `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh` every 2 hours. It extracts data from `eea.eea_hour`, creates files like `LM_02_lte_yyyyMMdd_000xx.txt`, and uploads them to `/lm` via SFTP. Validation includes checking `/shared/abc/location_mobility/logging/LM_02_lte_reconciliation.log` for the correct file entries and line counts.",
        "chatbot_answer": " The generation and validation of LTE data files for TrustCenter are part of the Location Mobility (LM) process. Specifically, these files are referred to as `LM_02_lte_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`.\n\n    These files are generated every time the script `/shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh` is executed with the appropriate parameters, such as `-t 20220313 --max-files 6`. This script is responsible for extracting the necessary data from BigStreamer and formatting it into the required file structure.\n\n    The validation of these files involves checking that they have been correctly generated and transferred to the exchange directory. This process is monitored by the TrustCenter service, which reads and deletes the files once they have been successfully processed.\n\n    In summary, the generation and validation of LTE data files for TrustCenter involve a combination of script execution, data extraction, file formatting, and monitoring by the TrustCenter service.",

Grep `A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline` for JVM errors:\n        ```\n        cat sdc.log | grep -i 'A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline'\n        ```\n        > ERROR ProductionPipelineRunnable - A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap     space java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n    1. Grep `ERROR` for any errors that might occur.\n```bash\n   cluster -> Streamsets -> Restart\n   ```\n4. Check Streamsets Process Options\n   ```bash\n   [root@un2 ~]# ps -ef | grep -i streamsets | grep -i xmx\n1. Open a pipeline. Check the generic summary (click anywhere in the board and select summary) to get an overview through dashboards on the data processed and errors. Also check if any job of the pipeline has errors (click on an action box and select tab Errors). Streamset will provide a specific ERROR message.\n**Step 2:** Look at the `logs`.\n**TO VIEW THE LOG FILE FOR A SPECIFIC PIPELINE:** `cat sdc.log | grep -i '<pipeline-grep-keyword>'`\nConcurrent Mark-Sweep GC\n   Heap Configuration:\n      MinHeapFreeRatio         = 40\n      MaxHeapFreeRatio         = 70\n      MaxHeapSize              = 34359738368 (32768.0MB)\n      NewSize                  = 2442723328 (2329.5625MB)\n      MaxNewSize               = 2442723328 (2329.5625MB)\n      OldSize                  = 31917015040 (30438.4375MB)\n      NewRatio                 = 2\n      SurvivorRatio            = 8\n      MetaspaceSize            = 21807104 (20.796875MB)",

Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n## Recommission\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors.

        "ground_truth": "1. Initial failure was due to unreachable impalad: `sn102.bigdata.abc.gr:22000`, caused by a memory-hogging query.\n2. Later failures related to a missing HDFS file triggered a 'Disk I/O error'.\n3. After dev team corrected the reference config table, the flow resumed.

        "chatbot_answer": " ```\n\nTo determine the cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved, we need to follow a series of troubleshooting steps as outlined in the provided context.\n\n1. **Identify System or Service Errors**: The first step involves checking the log files for any system or service errors that might have occurred during the execution of the Location Mobility flow on 2023-04-19.\n\n2. **Check for Specific Error Messages**: After identifying potential system or service errors, the next step is to look for specific error messages within the log files that are associated with the failed execution of the Location Mobility flow.\n\n3. **Analyze Lock Files and SQL Scripts**: If the issue persists after checking the log files and error messages, the next step involves analyzing the lock files and SQL scripts associated with the Location Mobility flow. This analysis can help identify any potential issues with file locking or database queries that might have contributed to the failure of the Location Mobility flow.\n\n4. **Review Reconciliation Logs**: Finally, reviewing the reconciliation logs for the Location Mobility flow can provide additional insights into what might have caused the failure and how it was resolved.\n\nBy following these troubleshooting steps and analyzing the relevant log files, lock files, SQL scripts, and reconciliation logs, it should be possible to determine the cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved. \n\nHowever, without access to the specific log files and other detailed information related to the failed execution of the Location Mobility flow on 2023-04-19, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to this question.\n\nIn conclusion, while we can outline the general steps that would be taken to troubleshoot and resolve the issue with the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19, without more detailed information, we cannot provide a specific cause or resolution for this particular incident. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to this question is: \n\nThe cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved could not be determined due to lack of access to specific log files and other detailed information related to the failed execution of the Location Mobility flow on that date.\n\nIt is recommended to refer to the actual log files, lock files, SQL scripts, and reconciliation logs associated with the Location Mobility flow for a more accurate and detailed analysis of the cause of the failure and how it was resolved. \n\nThis will enable a more thorough understanding of the issue and facilitate the development of effective solutions to prevent similar failures from occurring in the future. \n\nIn addition, it is also recommended to review the business documents related to the Location Mobility flow, which can be found at the link provided in the context, for a better understanding of the requirements and expectations associated with this flow. \n\nBy following these recommendations and taking a thorough and structured approach to troubleshooting and analysis, it should be possible to gain a deeper understanding of the cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved, and to develop effective strategies for preventing similar failures from occurring in the future. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to this question is: \n\nThe cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved could not be determined due to lack of access to specific log files and other detailed information related to the failed execution of the Location Mobility flow on that date.\n\nIt is recommended to refer to the actual log files, lock files, SQL scripts, and reconciliation logs associated with the Location Mobility flow for a more accurate and detailed analysis of the cause of the failure and how it was resolved. \n\nThis will enable a more thorough understanding of the issue and facilitate the development of effective solutions to prevent similar failures from occurring in the future. \n\nIn addition, it is also recommended to review the business documents related to the Location Mobility flow, which can be found at the link provided in the context, for a better understanding of the requirements and expectations associated with this flow. \n\nBy following these recommendations and taking a thorough and structured approach to troubleshooting and analysis, it should be possible to gain a deeper understanding of the cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved, and to develop effective strategies for preventing similar failures from occurring in the future. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{The cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved could not be determined due to lack of access to specific log files and other detailed information related to the failed execution of the Location Mobility flow on that date.}$ ```",

However, it discusses various data processing and monitoring tasks, including loading data to Redis DB, monitoring connection details, and handling errors in Streamset pipelines.\n\n    Given the lack of specific guidance on handling stale metadata or corrupted Parquet files in `osix.sip`, a general approach might involve:\n\n1. **Monitoring Data Integrity**: Regularly check for signs of data corruption or staleness, such as unexpected changes in file sizes, checksum mismatches, or reports of data inconsistencies from users.\n\n2. **Data Validation**: Implement robust data validation checks at various stages of the data processing pipeline. This can include checks for data type consistency, range checks, and checks for missing or null values.\n\n3. **Error Handling and Recovery**: Develop and implement effective error handling and recovery mechanisms. This should include logging errors, notifying operators or developers, and implementing automated recovery processes where possible.\n\n4. **Regular Maintenance and Updates**: Regularly perform maintenance tasks such as updating software dependencies, running data integrity checks, and performing backups. This helps ensure that the system remains healthy, secure, and performant over time.\n\nBy following these general guidelines, you can develop a robust strategy for handling stale metadata issues or corrupted Parquet files in `osix.sip`, even in the absence of specific guidance on this topic.",
