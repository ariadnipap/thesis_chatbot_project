        "question": "What is the correct procedure to resolve a failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data?",
        "category": "Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution",
        "ground_truth": "To resolve the EXPORT job failure due to a duplicate key, first check for duplicate entries in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg` using Impala Shell. Then, create backup and temp tables, remove the duplicate entry by ID and timestamp, and overwrite the original table. Finally, rerun the export script:\\n```bash\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " The correct procedure to resolve a failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the cause of failure**: Use the UC4 agent script logs and sqoop logs to identify the cause of the failure, which in this case is a duplicate key in the loan payment data.\n\n2. **Resolve the issue**: Once the cause of the failure has been identified, resolve the issue by removing or updating the duplicate key in the loan payment data.\n\n3. **Communicate with MNO UC4 administrators**: If the problem was temporary and you have fixed the issue, communicate with MNO UC4 administrators to rerun the job.\n\n4. **Rerun the job if necessary**: If the MNO UC4 administrators ask you to rerun the job, then do so using the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t payment\n    ```\n    For a specified date, use the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -d <date> -t payment\n    ```\n    Replace `<date>` with the desired date in the format `YYYYMMDD`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase', you can consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Monitor and Adjust Quotas**: Regularly monitor the HBase quotas and adjust them as necessary to prevent overloading and concurrency issues.\n\n2. **Implement Throttling**: Consider implementing throttling mechanisms on your HBase writes to control the rate at which data is written, thereby preventing sudden spikes that could lead to concurrency issues.\n\n3. **Optimize Impala Queries**: Ensure that your Impala queries are optimized for performance. This includes using efficient query structures, minimizing the amount of data being transferred or processed, and leveraging Impala's parallel processing capabilities.\n\n4. **Regular Maintenance and Monitoring**: Regularly perform maintenance tasks on your HBase and Impala systems, such as checking for and applying updates, monitoring system logs for errors or warnings, and performing backups to ensure data integrity and availability.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help mitigate Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for jobs using 'Upsert to HBase'. This approach focuses on proactive management and optimization of your HBase and Impala systems to prevent issues before they arise.",

This is because the new certificates will replace the old ones, and a restart is required for the changes to take effect.\n\n2. **Ensure Bigdatamanager Service Remains Stopped**: It's crucial that the `Bigdatamanager` service remains stopped at all times.\n\n3. **Recommission Node (If Necessary)**: If the issue persists after restarting services, consider recommissioning the node through Cloudera Manager. This should be done without starting roles initially to avoid potential failures.\n\n4. **Verify Service Health**: After completing these steps, verify that all Cloudera services are healthy and functioning as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of unhealthy Cloudera services due to NFS issues.",

Write a short feedback that assess the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.\n2. After writing a feedback, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5. You should refer to the score rubric.\n3. The output format should look as follows:\n\"Feedback: {write a feedback for criteria} [RESULT] {an integer number between 1 and 5}\"\n4. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations. Be sure to include [RESULT] in your output.\n\n###The instruction to evaluate:\nHow is the Radius flow triggered, and what are the key processing steps for radacct data?\n\n###Response to evaluate:\n The Radius flow is triggered once a day at 2:25 (UTC). For radacct data, the key processing steps include loading the data into Hive and Impala tables, computing statistics for the data, and applying retention policies to manage data storage. These steps are executed through various workflows and coordinators, including the Radius_Load_Coordinator and the Radius_Kudu_Retention_Coordinator. \n\n    The flow is designed to handle large volumes of data and ensure efficient processing and storage. The use of Hive and Impala tables allows for flexible querying and analysis of the data, while the retention policies help manage data storage and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. \n\n    Overall, the Radius flow is a critical component of the larger data processing and analytics ecosystem, and its design and implementation reflect the need for efficient, scalable, and compliant data processing and storage. \n\n    In addition to the main flow, there are also other related flows and processes that are worth noting. For example, the Router Analytics (RA) flow involves the extraction of data from BigStreamer into files, which are then compressed and transferred to an exchange directory for further processing. \n\n    Another example is the Input Performance Data (IPD) flow, which involves the collection and processing of performance data from various network elements. The IPD flow includes several sub-flows and processes, such as the creation of raw files, parsing of raw files, loading of parsed data into BigStreamer, and computation of statistics for the loaded data. \n\n    Overall, the Radius flow is just one part of a larger ecosystem of data processing and analytics flows and processes. Understanding the relationships and interactions between these different flows and processes is critical for ensuring the overall efficiency, scalability, and compliance of the data processing and analytics ecosystem as a whole. \n\n    In conclusion, the Radius flow is a complex and critical component of the larger data processing and analytics ecosystem.

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check IPVPN-SM script and app [logs](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ipvpn_sm_replacement.md#logs)\n##### Load interface_metrics\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Impala Table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist]\n  B[Computation of IF KPIs]\n  C[Impala Table: bigcust.interface_metrics]\n  A -->|Query|B\n  B -->|Load|C\n```\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Impala Table**: `bigcust.interface_metrics`\n#### Inspect specific metric request\nIn case of alerts, we should first check the status of the particular requests on the monitoring DB.\nUsing the metric category and the reference interval associated with a request to IPVPN-SM App we can query the Monitoring DB\nby passing the corresponding job and operative_partition values.\n3.

Check Streamsets Process Options\n   ```bash\n   [root@un2 ~]# ps -ef | grep -i streamsets | grep -i xmx\n1. Open a pipeline. Check the generic summary (click anywhere in the board and select summary) to get an overview through dashboards on the data processed and errors. Also check if any job of the pipeline has errors (click on an action box and select tab Errors).

If k8s version >1.24, create a secret:\n```yaml\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <secret>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <account>\n```\n3. Get kubeconfig with:\n```bash\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <namespace> <account> > ~/.kube/config\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To set up a Kubernetes service account for RAN.AI access with kubeconfig, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create Service Account**: Define a YAML file (`service_account.yml`) that contains the service account definition:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n2. **Create Role Binding**: Define another YAML file (`role_binding.yml`) for the role binding:\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\n3. **Apply Configurations**: Apply both YAML files in sequence using `kubectl apply`:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n4. **Generate Kubeconfig**: Use the `kubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig` command to generate a kubeconfig file for the service account. If you have installed the plugin, this can be done with:\n```bash\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nIf the plugin is not available, you will need to manually construct the kubeconfig file using the service account's token and certificate authority data.\n\n5. **Verify Kubeconfig**: After generating or constructing the kubeconfig file, verify its contents to ensure it matches your expectations for accessing the Kubernetes cluster with the specified service account.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up a Kubernetes service account for RAN.AI access with a properly configured kubeconfig file.",

Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the (instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing hte following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\n# Kubernetes User Environment Setup\n## Tools\nThe main tool that needs to be installed is **kubectl**, instructions for which can be found\n[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).

However, based on general knowledge of workflow management systems, here are some steps that could be taken to diagnose and prevent duplicate job submissions:\n1. **Review the workflow configuration**: Check the workflow definition to ensure that it is correctly configured to handle scheduled jobs.\n2. **Check the job submission history**: Review the job submission history to identify any instances of duplicate job submissions.\n3. **Implement a deduplication mechanism**: Consider implementing a deduplication mechanism, such as a unique job identifier or a checksum-based approach, to prevent duplicate job submissions.\n4. **Monitor and analyze workflow performance**: Regularly monitor and analyze workflow performance to identify any issues or bottlenecks that may be contributing to duplicate job submissions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help diagnose and prevent duplicate job submissions in CDSW for scheduled workflows like 'Set_Point_Automation'. \n``` # Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **Review the workflow configuration**: Check the workflow definition to ensure that it is correctly configured to handle scheduled jobs.\n2. **Check the job submission history**: Review the job submission history to identify any instances of duplicate job submissions.\n3. **Implement a deduplication mechanism**: Consider implementing a deduplication mechanism, such as a unique job identifier or a checksum-based approach, to prevent duplicate job submissions.\n\n# Fixed solution:\nTo diagnose and prevent duplicate job submissions in CDSW for scheduled workflows like 'Set_Point_Automation', you can implement the following fixed solution:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport hashlib\n\ndef generate_unique_job_id(job_name):\n    # Generate a unique job ID using a hash function\n    job_id = hashlib.sha256(job_name.encode()).hexdigest()\n    return job_id\n\ndef check_duplicate_job_submission(job_id):\n    # Check if a job with the same ID has already been submitted\n    job_submission_history = os.listdir('/path/to/job/submission/history')\n    for file in job_submission_history:\n        if file.startswith(job_id):\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\njob_name = 'Set_Point_Automation'\njob_id = generate_unique_job_id(job_name)\nif not check_duplicate_job_submission(job_id):\n    # Submit the job\n    print(f'Job {job_name} submitted successfully.')\nelse:\n    print(f'Job {job_name} has already been submitted.')\n```\n\n# Explanation of changes:\n*   **Unique Job ID Generation**: A unique job ID is generated using a hash function (SHA-256) to ensure uniqueness.\n*   **Duplicate Job Submission Check**: A check is implemented to verify if a job with the same ID has already been submitted.\n*   **Job Submission Logic**: The job submission logic is modified to generate a unique job ID, check for duplicate submissions, and submit the job only if it has not been submitted before.\n\n# Tests and example uses:\nTo test the fixed solution, you can use the following example test cases:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestUniqueJobIDGeneration(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_unique_job_id_generation(self):\n        job_name = 'Test_Job'\n        job_id = generate_unique_job_id(job_name)\n        self.assertIsNotNone(job_id)\n\nclass TestDuplicateJobSubmissionCheck(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_duplicate_job_submission_check(self):\n        job_name = 'Test_Job'\n        job_id = generate_unique_job_id(job_name)\n        duplicate_submission = check_duplicate_job_submission(job_id)\n        self.assertFalse(duplicate_submission)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nThese test cases cover the unique job ID generation and duplicate job submission check functionality.

Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n## Recommission\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors.

Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n## Decommission\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1.

        "category": "Data Management & Query Execution",
        "ground_truth": "1. Initial failure was due to unreachable impalad: `sn102.bigdata.abc.gr:22000`, caused by a memory-hogging query.\n2. Later failures related to a missing HDFS file triggered a 'Disk I/O error'.\n3. After dev team corrected the reference config table, the flow resumed.

        "chatbot_answer": " ```\n\nTo determine the cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved, we need to follow a series of troubleshooting steps as outlined in the provided context.\n\n1. **Identify System or Service Errors**: The first step involves checking the log files for any system or service errors that might have occurred during the execution of the Location Mobility flow on 2023-04-19.\n\n2. **Check for Specific Error Messages**: After identifying potential system or service errors, the next step is to look for specific error messages within the log files that are associated with the failed execution of the Location Mobility flow.\n\n3. **Analyze Lock Files and SQL Scripts**: If the issue persists after checking the log files and error messages, the next step involves analyzing the lock files and SQL scripts associated with the Location Mobility flow. This analysis can help identify any potential issues with file locking or database queries that might have contributed to the failure of the Location Mobility flow.\n\n4. **Review Reconciliation Logs**: Finally, reviewing the reconciliation logs for the Location Mobility flow can provide valuable insights into how the issue was resolved. The reconciliation logs typically contain information about the files that were successfully exported and transferred to the exchange directory, as well as any errors or issues that were encountered during the process.\n\nBy following these troubleshooting steps and analyzing the relevant log files, error messages, lock files, SQL scripts, and reconciliation logs, it should be possible to determine the cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved. \n\nHowever, without specific details about the failure, such as error messages or log entries, it's challenging to provide a precise answer to what caused the failure and how it was resolved.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, troubleshooting involves a detailed analysis of system logs, application logs, and sometimes even network packet captures, depending on the nature of the issue. Without access to these specific logs and details for the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19, providing an accurate cause and resolution is not feasible. \n```",

These platforms are designed to handle high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data streams, and they provide features such as buffering, caching, and parallel processing to help reduce latency and improve overall system performance.\n\nBy considering these options and evaluating which ones might be the best fit for your specific use case and requirements, you should be able to identify opportunities to reduce export latency and improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of your data export process.",
