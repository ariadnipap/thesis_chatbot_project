        "category": "Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution",
        "ground_truth": "To resolve the EXPORT job failure due to a duplicate key, first check for duplicate entries in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg` using Impala Shell. Then, create backup and temp tables, remove the duplicate entry by ID and timestamp, and overwrite the original table. Finally, rerun the export script:\\n```bash\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " The correct procedure to resolve a failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data is as follows:\n1. Use the UC4 agent script logs and sqoop logs to identify the cause of the failure.\n2. Check if the previous day was a business day. If not, the export job will not be executed.\n3. The script cleans up after failure, so if the problem was temporary, communicate with MNO UC4 administrators to rerun the job if you fixed the problem.\n4. To rerun the job for loan payment data, use the following command:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\n```\nFor a specified date, add the `-p` option followed by the desired date in `YYYYMMDD` format. For example:\n```bash\n# eg. 09-11-2019 (Ndef that the argument is one day after the desired date)\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment -p 20191109\n```\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data.",

For example by moving a service_audit partiton from DR to PR or vice versa, or when merge batch failed **after** deleting transactions from kudu.\nIn that case we can manually mark merge batch as complete for that date, and therefore next oozie job created by `Coord_OnlineCreateKuduPartitionsPROD` will delete that partition from kudu, by manipulating HBase table `PROD_ONLINE:MERGE_BATCH_STATE_INFO`.\nExample for a specific date (10/10/2022):\n - Run HBase shell\n ```\n   hbase shell\n   ```\n - And then inside HBase shell:\n ```\n   put 'PROD_ONLINE:MERGE_BATCH_STATE_INFO', 'MergeBatchInfoKey_20221010', 'MergaBatchState:drop_hbase', 'true'\n```\n  - For a specified date:\n    ``` bash\n    # eg. 09-11-2019\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/cronExecutor_MergeBatchWithLock_hdfs_STABLE.sh /user/PRODREST/lock/PROD_IBank_MergeBatch LOCK_IBANK_PROD_BATCH_MERGE_TRANS /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh PROD_IBank_MergeBatch  /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/lock/ FULL 1800 \"2019-11-09 00:00:00\" \"2019-11-10 00:00:00\"   >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log 2>&1 &\n    ```\n- The process runs for well over an hour under normal circumstances or even longer for heavy load. Use of `screen` command advised\n- If the problem is with resources (out-of-memory errors):\n  - You can adjust the values at `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh`. At the moment these values are as high as they can go.\n  - You can run the MergeBatch for parts of the day\n    ``` bash\n    # eg. 09-11-2019\n- On the active site:\n    ``` bash\n    vi /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_STABLE_v2.sh\n    # Comment the followin lines along with the assosiated checks\n    # touch /home/bank_central_mno_gr/datawarehouse_status/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n    # touch /opt/applications/landing_zone/PRODUSER/triggers/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n    ```  \n  - On the passive site:\n    ``` bash\n    vi /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_STABLE_v2.sh\n    # Uncomment the followin lines along with the assosiated checks\n    # touch /home/bank_central_mno_gr/datawarehouse_status/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n    # touch /opt/applications/landing_zone/PRODUSER/triggers/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n    ```",

        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase', you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the logs**: Look for any errors or warnings in the logs that may indicate the cause of the concurrency issue.\n\n2. **Verify HBase quotas**: Check if there are any HBase quotas set that may be causing the concurrency issue. You can use the `hbase shell` command to check and modify HBase quotas.\n\n3. **Adjust Impala settings**: If the issue is related to Impala, you can try adjusting Impala settings such as the number of concurrent queries or the memory allocation for Impala.\n\n4. **Optimize HBase table design**: If the issue is related to HBase, you can try optimizing the HBase table design by adjusting the number of regions, the region size, or the column family design.\n\n5. **Monitor and analyze performance metrics**: Finally, monitor and analyze performance metrics such as query latency, throughput, and resource utilization to identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase'.",

Go to ```Cloudera Manager => HBase => Configuration => HBase Service Advanced configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hbase-site.xml```\n2. Add the following configuration:\n   ```\n   Name: hbase.quota.enabled\n   Value: true\n   Description: enable hbase quotas\n   ```\n3. Restart HBase service\n## Add HBase quotas to a namespace\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n   ```bash\n   cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\n   ls \u2013ltr HBASE\n   cd <latest hbase process folder>\n   kinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n   ```\n3. Get list of namespaces\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   list_namespace\n   ```\n4. Set throttle READ quotas \n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => \u2018namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n   ```\n5. Set throttle WRITE quotas\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => \u2018namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n   ```\n6. Show all quotas\n   ```bash\n**Alerts**:\n- **Not Monitored**\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/report_duplicates_kudu_hbase_impala.log` for errors\n- You can safely skip this step if not running for the previous day\n- Sample execution:\n  ``` bash\n  /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/report_duplicates_kudu_hbase_impala_STABLE.sh `date --date='-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'` prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream prod_trlog_online.service_audit_old online >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/report_duplicates_kudu_hbase_impala.log 2>&1\n  ```\n### Hourly Merge Batch\nEvery hour a  transfers transactions ingested by the [Stream](#stream) flow to an intermediate table and without deleting the data from the original tables.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n```\n5. Set throttle WRITE quotas\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => \u2018namespace', LIMIT => 'Xreq/sec'\n   ```\n6. Show all quotas\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   list_quotas\n   ```\n## Remove HBase quotas from a namespace\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n   ```bash\n   cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\n   ls \u2013ltr HBASE\n   cd <latest hbase process folder>\n   kinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n   ```\n3. Get list of namespaces and list of quotas already set\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   list_namespace\n   list_quotas\n   ```\n4. Delete throttle quotas\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => \u2018namespace', LIMIT => NONE\n   ```\n5. Verify that quotas have been removed\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   list_quotas\n   ```\n```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_read_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => WRITE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n-  Delete and recreate table to repeat to run tests with write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    n_splits = 300\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'write'\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\nlist_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n- Set throttle quotas of type 'read'\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'read'\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\nn_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/hbase2\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads\nhttps://blog.cloudera.com/hbase-performance-testing-using-ycsb/",

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

After tablets restart, retry the table creation query.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve a Kudu table creation error due to a 'Thrift SASL frame too long' error, you can try increasing the maximum allowed frame size in the Kudu configuration. This can be done by setting the `kudu.rpc.max_frame_size` property to a higher value, such as 1048576 (1MB). You can also try increasing the `kudu.tserver.negotiation.buffer.size` property to a higher value, such as 65536 (64KB). It's recommended to test these changes in a non-production environment before applying them to your production cluster. Additionally, you can also try to check the Kudu table creation script and make sure that it is not trying to create a table with too many columns or with column names that are too long.     ```sql\n    ALTER TABLE dev_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1' <= VALUES < 'v2';\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala (older than the last 10 days), do: `ALTER table <database>.<table> DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt = '<date>')`, where `<date>` is the date of the partition to be dropped.\n\n    ```sql\n    ALTER TABLE dev_trlog_ibank.service_audit DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt = '2022-01-01');\n    ```\n**Step 3:** In `Hue` as `intra`, create new partitions for kudu table and/or impala table that overlap with the required interval. \n  -

        "chatbot_answer": " To address the issue of all Cloudera services appearing unhealthy due to NFS issues, follow these steps:\n1. **Stop all Cloudera services**: Use Cloudera Manager to stop all services to prevent any further data corruption or inconsistencies.\n2. **Unmount and remount NFS shares**: Unmount the problematic NFS shares from the nodes where they are mounted. Then, remount them to ensure that the mounts are healthy and functioning correctly.\n3. **Check for and resolve any underlying issues with the NFS server or network connectivity**: Investigate whether there are any problems with the NFS server itself, such as configuration errors, disk space issues, or software bugs. Also, check the network connectivity between the nodes mounting the NFS shares and the NFS server to ensure that it is stable and not causing any issues.\n4. **Start Cloudera services in a controlled manner**: Once all underlying issues have been resolved, start the Cloudera services one by one, monitoring their health and performance closely after each service is started.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of all Cloudera services appearing unhealthy due to NFS problems.",

Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present.

        "category": "Data Management & Query Execution",
        "ground_truth": "Ensure the correct number of partitions is used. In the case of the Online MergeBatch job, 468 partitions caused timeout errors. It was fixed by adjusting to 180 partitions for `prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream` and deleting unnecessary Kudu disk data.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs, you can consider the following options:\n\n1. **Increase the timeout value**: You can increase the timeout value for Kudu scans in your Spark configuration. This will give the Kudu scan more time to complete before timing out.\n\n2. **Optimize your Kudu table schema**: Make sure that your Kudu table schema is optimized for query performance. This includes choosing the right data types, using efficient primary keys, and avoiding unnecessary columns.\n\n3. **Increase the number of Kudu tablets**: If you have a high-volume Kudu table, increasing the number of tablets can help spread the load and reduce the likelihood of scan timeouts.\n\n4. **Use Kudu's parallel scan feature**: Kudu provides a parallel scan feature that allows you to split a scan into multiple smaller scans that can be executed in parallel. This can help improve scan performance and reduce the likelihood of timeouts.\n\n5. **Monitor your Kudu cluster's performance**: Keep an eye on your Kudu cluster's performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. This can help you identify potential performance bottlenecks and take corrective action before they cause scan timeouts.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs and improve the overall reliability and performance of your data pipeline.",

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n- Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/update_customer_sla_config.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log file.\n## Output Performance Data\nFor every 5-minute interval 5 HTTP requests containing CPU load, memory utilization, QoS, availability and interface utilization are sent to SQM server containing instanenous metrics for network elements and are moved to an exchange directory. Also these metrics are stored into an Impala table.\n### CPU and Memory\n#### Main script\nA procedure is executed periodically that triggers IPVPN-SM App to compute and transmit to the SQM server via HTTP the metrics for CPU and memory KPIs of the network elements. The procedure also inserts the KPIs into an Impala table. These three sub-steps are executed in parallel.\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Scheduler**: `Cron`\n**Schedule**: `Every 5 minutes`\n**Exchange user**: `saismpm`\n**Exchange path**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm`\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check IPVPN-SM script and app [logs](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ipvpn_sm_replacement.md#logs)\n##### Load interface_metrics\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Impala Table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist]\n  B[Computation of IF KPIs]\n  C[Impala Table: bigcust.interface_metrics]\n  A -->|Query|B\n  B -->|Load|C\n```\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Impala Table**: `bigcust.interface_metrics`\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/populate_interface_metrics_table.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/populate_interface_metrics_table.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log files e.g failed Impala query.\n## Output Configuration Data\nPeriodically an XML file that contains information about VPN customers with configuration changes, is produced by one of the Wildfly instances and is transferred to an exchange directory using a shell script.\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n2.

Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/populate_components_metrics_table.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/populate_components_metrics_table.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log files e.g failed Impala query.\n### QoS and Availability\n#### Main script\nA procedure is executed periodically that triggers IPVPN-SM App to compute and transmit to the SQM server via HTTP the metrics for QoS and availability KPIs of the network elements.

Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:",

Otherwise e.g grep nodew /etc/hosts \n```\nIf the ipmitool package did not exist just install it. yum install ipmitool;\n```\n3. connect via vnc. Open firefox and type the `IP Address` from step 2\n4. From `Server-->Overview-->Server Information` copy the `Service Tag number`\n5. Call Dell support `2108129800`. They need the `Service Tag number` from step 4\n6. An engineer will create a case and sent you all the necessary steps. If not the link to collect the TSR logs is `https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/el-gr/000126803/export-a-supportassist-collection-via-idrac7-and-idrac8`\n7.

Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n## Decommission\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\norder by a.id\n    ;\n\t```\n### Monitoring Health-Check\n  - Check Monitoring status.  \n\t```\t\n\t$ curl --location --request GET 'http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800/monitoring/app/check'\n\t\n\t{\"code\":0,\"info\":\"App is up and running.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\n...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n    ```log\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n    Now replication works.\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```",

Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the (instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing hte following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\n# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring. In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n## Procedure\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n**Schedule:** `Every 5 minutes`  \n**Pod Script:** `/app/run_vdsl2.sh`  \n**Main Configuration File:** `/app/conf/application.yaml`  \n**Logs:** Use `kubectl logs` to view `stdout`  \n**Hadoop Table:** `bigcust.vdsl2`\n## Application Components\n### SNMP Polling of Elements\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Piraeus Bank VTUs] -->|SNMP Polling| B[File: nnmcp.vdsl-g*.\\*.txt <br> Path: /app/work/data <br> Pod ]\n```\nThe application polls data using SNMP.

Streaming and batch procedures are running in both sites. External traffic and UC4 flows however are only active in one of them. \n## Procedure\n### Stop streaming procedures\n1. Stop production IBank, Online Spark topologies:\n    - Login with your personal account at `dr1edge01` or `pr1edge01`, based on the site that will be stopped.\n    - Switch user to `PRODREST`.\n    - Comment lines in crontab that run `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/restart_topology_STABLE.sh` and `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/restart_visible_topology.sh`.\n    - Create `SHUTDOWN` markers for the Spark topologies.\n      \n      ``` bash\n      [PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n- If the alert chart has **no line**, ensure that the application is not running (Cloudera Manager > YARN > Applications) and then submit the topology using the **Submit Script**.\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase for delays and check the application logs for any errors.

At the end of each day (at **1:00 am in PR site** and **2:00 am in DR site** by **Cron**) the records from HBase/Kudu is enriched with additional information and the transfered to a parquet table. After the data are inserted to the parquet table, sequent jobs are triggered to produce aggregations and data for external systems.

Update Morphline rounding:\n```bash\n{ extractTimeBucket { field : file, bucket:5, rounding:mathematical } }\n```\n2. Restart Flume agent.\n3.

        "chatbot_answer": " To address the issue of missing or delayed exported CPU and Memory metrics files, we need to investigate the root cause. \n\n    Based on the provided context, here are some potential reasons for the missing or delayed files:\n\n1.  **NNM Export Issues**: The NNM system might be experiencing issues with exporting the CPU and Memory metrics files. This could be due to various reasons such as configuration errors, resource constraints, or software bugs.\n\n2.  **SFTP Transfer Delays**: The SFTP transfer process from `nnmprd01` to the destination server might be experiencing delays. This could be due to network congestion, firewall issues, or problems with the SFTP server or client.\n\n3.  **Script Execution Issues**: The script responsible for exporting the CPU and Memory metrics files might be experiencing execution issues. This could be due to various reasons such as syntax errors, permission issues, or dependency problems.\n\nTo reduce export latency, consider the following strategies:\n\n1.  **Optimize NNM Export Configuration**: Review and optimize the NNM export configuration to ensure that it is properly set up for exporting CPU and Memory metrics files.\n\n2.  **Implement SFTP Transfer Optimization Techniques**: Implement SFTP transfer optimization techniques such as using parallel transfers, compressing data, or using faster SFTP clients or servers.\n\n3.  **Schedule Script Execution During Off-Peak Hours**: Schedule the script execution during off-peak hours when system resources are less utilized. This can help reduce contention for resources and minimize the impact of script execution on other system activities.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help reduce export latency and ensure that CPU and Memory metrics files are exported in a timely manner.",

Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day.

        "chatbot_answer": " To reprocess RADIUS files for missing data during system downtime, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Suspend the Coordinator**: Suspend the `Radius_Load_Coordinator` to prevent any new executions of the flow while you are reprocessing the missed files.\n2.  **Drop Partitions**: Drop the partitions from the tables that were not properly loaded due to the system downtime. This step ensures that you start with a clean slate for loading the missed files.\n\n    For radarchive category of files:\n    ```sql\n    alter table radius.radarchive drop partitions (par_dt=\"<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.: 20220915>\")\n    ```\n    For radacct category of files:\n    ```sql\n    alter table radius.radacct drop partitions (par_dt=\"<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.: 20220915>\")\n    ```\n3.  **Rename Files on SFTP Server**: Connect to the SFTP server and rename the files that correspond to the missed data. Remove the `.LOADED` suffix from these filenames so that they can be reprocessed.\n\n    Example command to rename a file:\n    ```bash\n    sftp> rename <filename>.LOADED <filename>\n    ```\n4.  **Resume the Coordinator**: Once you have completed the above steps, resume the `Radius_Load_Coordinator`. This will allow the next execution of the flow to load any files that were delayed or failed to be loaded in a previous execution.\n\nBy following these steps, you can reprocess RADIUS files for missing data during system downtime. This ensures that your data is complete and up-to-date, which is critical for accurate analysis and decision-making.",

Use hourly row counts from `radacct_hist` to identify anomalies.\n2. Search cron logs like:\n```bash\ngrep -B5 Modified /shared/abc/radius/log/000_radius_ops.20210506.log\n```\n3. If the file exists in `radacct_orig_files`, copy it to load:\n```bash\nhdfs dfs -cp /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_orig_files/... /ez/warehouse/radius.db/radacct_load/\n```\n4.
