        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve 'OutOfMemoryError' issues on the Spark History Server in Cloudera, you can try increasing the Java heap size for the Spark History Server. This can be done by modifying the `SPARK_DAEMON_MEMORY` environment variable or by adding the `-Xmx` option to the `SPARK_HISTORY_OPTS` environment variable. For example, you can add the following line to the `spark-defaults.conf` file: `spark.history.opts=-Xmx16384m`.

        "chatbot_answer": " The provided context does not mention the causes of a YARN Node Manager failure or how it can be mitigated. However, based on general knowledge of YARN and Hadoop, some common causes of YARN Node Manager failures include:\n\n* Insufficient resources (e.g., memory, CPU) on the node\n* Network connectivity issues between the node and the YARN Resource Manager\n* Configuration errors or inconsistencies in the YARN configuration files\n* Software bugs or compatibility issues with other components in the Hadoop ecosystem\n\nTo mitigate these issues, it is recommended to:\n\n* Monitor node resource utilization and adjust resource allocations as needed\n* Verify network connectivity and configure network settings appropriately\n* Review and validate YARN configuration files for accuracy and consistency\n* Stay up-to-date with the latest software releases and patches, and test compatibility with other components in the Hadoop ecosystem.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can help minimize the risk of YARN Node Manager failures and ensure a more stable and reliable Hadoop environment.",

        "chatbot_answer": " The Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank can be rerun by executing the script `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/cronExecutor_MergeBatchWithLock_hdfs_STABLE.sh`. This is done in patches because the process runs for well over an hour under normal circumstances or even longer for heavy load. Additionally, if the problem is with resources (out-of-memory errors), running the Merge Batch in patches can help to avoid these issues. \n\n    Furthermore, it's also possible to adjust the values at `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh` to optimize the performance of the Merge Batch job.\n\n    In summary, rerunning a failed Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank involves executing a specific script and running the process in patches to avoid issues with resources and to optimize performance. \n\n    Note: The use of `screen` command is advised when running the Merge Batch job to ensure that the process continues to run even if the user's session is disconnected. \n\n    Also, it's worth noting that the Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank can be a complex process that involves multiple steps and dependencies. Therefore, it's recommended to carefully review the logs and output of the job to identify any issues or errors that may have occurred during the execution of the job. \n\n    Finally, it's also important to note that the Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank is typically run on a scheduled basis, such as daily or weekly, depending on the specific requirements of the job. Therefore, it's recommended to carefully review the scheduling and frequency of the job to ensure that it is running at the correct intervals and that any issues or errors are being properly addressed. \n\n    In conclusion, rerunning a failed Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank requires careful attention to detail and a thorough understanding of the complex processes and dependencies involved in the job. By following the steps outlined above and carefully reviewing the logs and output of the job, it is possible to successfully rerun a failed Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank and ensure that any issues or errors are properly addressed. \n\n    It's also worth noting that the process of rerunning a failed Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank can be complex and time-consuming, and may require significant resources and expertise.

For example by moving a service_audit partiton from DR to PR or vice versa, or when merge batch failed **after** deleting transactions from kudu.\nIn that case we can manually mark merge batch as complete for that date, and therefore next oozie job created by `Coord_OnlineCreateKuduPartitionsPROD` will delete that partition from kudu, by manipulating HBase table `PROD_ONLINE:MERGE_BATCH_STATE_INFO`.\nExample for a specific date (10/10/2022):\n - Run HBase shell\n ```\n   hbase shell\n   ```\n - And then inside HBase shell:\n ```\n   put 'PROD_ONLINE:MERGE_BATCH_STATE_INFO', 'MergeBatchInfoKey_20221010', 'MergaBatchState:drop_hbase', 'true'\n```\n  - For a specified date:\n    ``` bash\n    # eg. 09-11-2019\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/cronExecutor_MergeBatchWithLock_hdfs_STABLE.sh /user/PRODREST/lock/PROD_IBank_MergeBatch LOCK_IBANK_PROD_BATCH_MERGE_TRANS /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh PROD_IBank_MergeBatch  /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/lock/ FULL 1800 \"2019-11-09 00:00:00\" \"2019-11-10 00:00:00\"   >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log 2>&1 &\n    ```\n- The process runs for well over an hour under normal circumstances or even longer for heavy load.

        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase', you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the logs**: Look for any errors or warnings in the logs that may indicate the cause of the concurrency issue.\n\n2. **Verify HBase quotas**: Check if there are any HBase quotas set that may be causing the concurrency issue. You can use the `hbase shell` command to check and modify HBase quotas.\n\n3. **Adjust Impala settings**: If you find that the concurrency issue is caused by Impala settings, you can try adjusting these settings to improve performance. For example, you can increase the number of Impala daemons or adjust the memory allocation for each daemon.\n\n4. **Optimize HBase table design**: If you find that the concurrency issue is caused by poor HBase table design, you can try optimizing the table design to improve performance. For example, you can use a more efficient row key design or optimize the column family and column qualifier designs.\n\n5. **Monitor and analyze performance metrics**: Finally, it's essential to monitor and analyze performance metrics to identify any potential issues that may be causing the concurrency issue. You can use tools like Cloudera Manager or HBase shell commands to monitor and analyze performance metrics.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase'.",

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n- Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/update_customer_sla_config.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log file.\n## Output Performance Data\nFor every 5-minute interval 5 HTTP requests containing CPU load, memory utilization, QoS, availability and interface utilization are sent to SQM server containing instanenous metrics for network elements and are moved to an exchange directory. Also these metrics are stored into an Impala table.\n### CPU and Memory\n#### Main script\nA procedure is executed periodically that triggers IPVPN-SM App to compute and transmit to the SQM server via HTTP the metrics for CPU and memory KPIs of the network elements. The procedure also inserts the KPIs into an Impala table. These three sub-steps are executed in parallel.\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Scheduler**: `Cron`\n**Schedule**: `Every 5 minutes`\n**Exchange user**: `saismpm`\n**Exchange path**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm`\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check IPVPN-SM script and app [logs](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ipvpn_sm_replacement.md#logs)\n##### Load interface_metrics\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Impala Table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist]\n  B[Computation of IF KPIs]\n  C[Impala Table: bigcust.interface_metrics]\n  A -->|Query|B\n  B -->|Load|C\n```\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Impala Table**: `bigcust.interface_metrics`\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/populate_interface_metrics_table.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/populate_interface_metrics_table.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log files e.g failed Impala query.\n## Output Configuration Data\nPeriodically an XML file that contains information about VPN customers with configuration changes, is produced by one of the Wildfly instances and is transferred to an exchange directory using a shell script.\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/populate_components_metrics_table.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/populate_components_metrics_table.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log files e.g failed Impala query.\n### QoS and Availability\n#### Main script\nA procedure is executed periodically that triggers IPVPN-SM App to compute and transmit to the SQM server via HTTP the metrics for QoS and availability KPIs of the network elements.

Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:",

        "chatbot_answer": " The process for replacing hardware on a BigStreamer node and contacting Dell support involves several steps. \n\n1. First, the user needs to ssh into the issue node with their personal account.\n2. Then, they need to find the management IP address of the IDRAC using the `ipmitool` command.\n3. Next, the user needs to connect to the IDRAC via VNC and open Firefox to access the IDRAC web interface.\n4. From the IDRAC web interface, the user needs to copy the Service Tag number of the server.\n5. Then, the user needs to call Dell support at the provided phone number and provide the Service Tag number to create a case.\n6. After creating a case, an engineer will provide the necessary steps to replace the hardware and collect TSR logs from IDRAC.\n\nIt's also important to note that before taking any action on the IDRAC, the user should inform \"abc\" to ensure proper coordination and approval. \n\nAdditionally, if the monitoring application is stopped, the user should follow the instructions provided in the \"start monitoring-app\" procedure described in the Monitoring application document. \n\nIn case of any issues or failures during the replacement process, the user can refer to the troubleshooting section, which provides information on how to identify and resolve common issues. \n\nOverall, replacing hardware on a BigStreamer node and contacting Dell support requires careful planning, coordination, and execution to ensure minimal downtime and optimal system performance.",

Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n## Decommission\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\norder by a.id\n    ;\n\t```\n### Monitoring Health-Check\n  - Check Monitoring status.  \n\t```\t\n\t$ curl --location --request GET 'http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800/monitoring/app/check'\n\t\n\t{\"code\":0,\"info\":\"App is up and running.

For example: `-Xmx32768m -Xms32768m -server -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow`.\n\n2. **Remove Old Configuration**:\n   - Go to `cluster-> Streamsets -> Configuration`.\n   - In the `Data Collector Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for sdc-env.sh` field, remove any lines that set `SDC_JAVA_OPTS`, especially those that might conflict with the new Java heap size settings.\n\n3. **Restart Streamsets**:\n   - Go to `cluster -> Streamsets -> Restart`.\n   - Confirm the restart operation to apply the changes.\n\n4. **Check Streamsets Process Options**:\n   - Use a command like `ps -ef | grep -i streamsets | grep -i xmx` to verify that the Java process running Streamsets is using the newly configured heap size.\n\n5. **Check Max Java Heap Space for Streamsets via jconsole or jmap**:\n   - For **jconsole**, ensure you have the necessary Java options set (like `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true`), then connect to the Streamsets process and navigate to the memory pool to check the heap size.\n   - For **jmap**, use a command like `jmap -heap <pid>` where `<pid>` is the process ID of the Streamsets Java process. This will display information about the heap, including its size.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively increase the Java heap space for Streamsets and validate that the changes have taken effect.",

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\n...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the (instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing hte following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\n# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring. In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n## Procedure\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n```\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n**Schedule:** `Every 5 minutes`  \n**Pod Script:** `/app/run_vdsl2.sh`  \n**Main Configuration File:** `/app/conf/application.yaml`  \n**Logs:** Use `kubectl logs` to view `stdout`  \n**Hadoop Table:** `bigcust.vdsl2`\n## Application Components\n### SNMP Polling of Elements\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Piraeus Bank VTUs] -->|SNMP Polling| B[File: nnmcp.vdsl-g*.\\*.txt <br> Path: /app/work/data <br> Pod ]\n```\nThe application polls data using SNMP.

This will help you identify if a job is still running or has completed.\n\n3. **Check for duplicate submissions**: Before submitting a new job, check the list of recently submitted jobs to ensure that you are not accidentally submitting a duplicate job.\n\n4. **Use unique identifiers**: When submitting jobs, use unique identifiers or parameters that can help distinguish one job from another. This can prevent accidental duplicate submissions.\n\n5. **Implement automation checks**: Consider implementing automated checks within your workflow that can detect and prevent duplicate job submissions.

However, the steps outlined in the response differ significantly from those described in the reference answer. Specifically, the reference answer emphasizes accessing iDRAC for server logs, performing a cold reboot via iDRAC, and then verifying the agent status on the node. In contrast, the provided response focuses on checking the host's status in Cloudera Manager, investigating CPU errors through system logs, performing basic troubleshooting steps such as ensuring network reachability and verifying the Cloudera Manager agent is running, recommissioning the host if necessary, and finally starting roles on the host to bring it back into operation. Given these differences, while the response provides a comprehensive approach to troubleshooting and recovering a Cloudera host, its deviation from the reference answer's steps indicates that it may not be entirely correct or accurate in the context of the specific problem described.

Streaming and batch procedures are running in both sites. External traffic and UC4 flows however are only active in one of them. \n## Procedure\n### Stop streaming procedures\n1. Stop production IBank, Online Spark topologies:\n    - Login with your personal account at `dr1edge01` or `pr1edge01`, based on the site that will be stopped.\n    - Switch user to `PRODREST`.\n    - Comment lines in crontab that run `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/restart_topology_STABLE.sh` and `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/restart_visible_topology.sh`.\n    - Create `SHUTDOWN` markers for the Spark topologies.\n      \n      ``` bash\n      [PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n- If the alert chart has **no line**, ensure that the application is not running (Cloudera Manager > YARN > Applications) and then submit the topology using the **Submit Script**.\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase for delays and check the application logs for any errors. You can also try to kill (use Cloudera Manager or yarn command) and then re-submit the topology.\n## Batch\n### Main script\nAs mentioned before, the information processed by the [Prod_IBANK_IngestStream](#prod_ibank_ingeststream) topology is stored in Kudu/HBase tables. At the end of each day (at **1:00 am in PR site** and **2:00 am in DR site** by **Cron**) the records from HBase/Kudu is enriched with additional information and the transfered to a parquet table. After the data are inserted to the parquet table, sequent jobs are triggered to produce aggregations and data for external systems. This procedure runs **independantly on both sites**.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\nor check via the corresponding [Grafana dashboard](https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/J4KPyBoVk/radius-dashboard?orgId=1&from=now-2d&to=now)\n  - Check the logs for the failed execution.\n- After the underlying problem has been corrected the next execution of the flow will load any files that have been delayed or failed to be loaded in a previous execution.\n- If the customer requests to load specific files after they have been processed by the flow. **In order to avoid duplicate data we have to reload the whole partition.**\n  - Ensure the files are still available on the SFTP server\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n  \n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n    # Check for files covering the whole date affected\n    sftp> ls -l *.LOADED\n    ```\n  \n  - Suspend coordinator `Radius_Load_Coordinator`\n  - Drop partitions that were not properly loaded from following tables\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n- Create `SHUTDOWN` markers for the Spark topologies.\n      \n      ``` bash\n      [PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n      [PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n      [PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n      [PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n      ```\n    - Wait for 5 minutes and check that the above applications are no longer running.\n      ``` bash\n      [PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep PRODUSER\n      ```\n1.

Optimize the **Export** procedure by improving its efficiency, reducing unnecessary steps, and leveraging parallel processing capabilities if available.\n3.  Implement a robust error handling mechanism within the **Export** procedure to detect and recover from errors quickly, minimizing the impact on export latency.\n4.  Consider deploying additional resources, such as extra servers or processing power, to support the **Export** procedure and help reduce export latency.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can help identify and address the root causes of missing or delayed exported CPU and Memory metrics files, ultimately reducing export latency and improving overall system performance.",

Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n# Energy-Efficiency Pollaploi\n## Overview\nThis is an `Oozie Flow` responsible to **load data** from **txt files** into **impala tables**.

This will ensure that these files are not processed again and do not cause any inconsistencies in the data.\n4. **Re-run the load process**: Once the above steps have been completed, re-run the load process to ingest the data from the `radacct_orig_files` into the `radius.radacct_hist` table.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to restore the `radius.radacct_hist` table and ensure that it contains accurate and complete data.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To reprocess RADIUS files for missing data during system downtime, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Suspend the Coordinator**: Suspend the `Radius_Load_Coordinator` to prevent any new executions of the flow while you are reprocessing the missed files.\n2.  **Drop Partitions**: Drop the partitions from the tables that were not properly loaded due to the system downtime. This step ensures that you start with a clean slate for loading the missed files.\n\n    For `radarchive` category of files:\n\n    ```sql\nalter table radius.radarchive drop partitions (par_dt=\"<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.: 20220915>\")\n```\n\n    For `radacct` category of files:\n\n    ```sql\nalter table radius.radacct drop partitions (par_dt=\"<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.: 20220915>\")\n```\n\n3.  **Rename Files on SFTP Server**: Connect to the SFTP server and rename the files that correspond to the missed data. Remove the `.LOADED` suffix from these filenames.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```bash\nsftp> rename <filename>.LOADED <filename>\n```\n\n4.  **Resume the Coordinator**: Resume the `Radius_Load_Coordinator`. This will trigger the next execution of the flow, which will load any files that were delayed or failed to be loaded in previous executions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can reprocess RADIUS files for missing data during system downtime and ensure that your data is up-to-date and accurate.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To re-run the Huawei TV flow manually for a date with missing partitions, follow these steps:\n1. Ensure you are running as the `PRODREST` user.\n2. Go to the script logs directory: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/update_online_aggr_tables.log`.\n3. Run the script with arguments using the following command:\n```bash\nnohup /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/update_online_aggr_tables_STABLE.sh \"prod_trlog_online.service_audit_hourly\" \"<date>\" >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/update_online_aggr_tables.log 2>&1 &\n```\nReplace `<date>` with the date for which you want to re-run the flow.\n4. Go to logs and check both stdout and stderr for any errors or issues.\n5. If a partition has partially been inserted into the final table `prometheus.dwh22` and the error that caused the failure has been resolved, follow these additional steps:\n\t* Drop the existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval using the following command:\n```sql\nALTER TABLE prometheus.dwh22 DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='<par_dt>');\n```\nReplace `<par_dt>` with the partition date for which you want to drop the partition.\n6. If the flow is still failing after re-running it, investigate the logs and error messages to identify the root cause of the issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to re-run the Huawei TV flow manually for a date with missing partitions.",
        "retrieved_context": "```\nselect count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;\n```\nCommand `refresh tables` might be needed.\n**Step 5:** If the `returned result of records of the impala query` is equal to the `returned result of 'wc -l \\*\\_YYYYMMDD-HHMMss.csv' -1`, then the flow was executed correctly for the csv file for the examined date.\n**Step 6:** Clear the local directory from the unnecessary fetched data.\n---\n#### Manually inserting missing data in Hive and Impala\n---\nTo manually insert missing data in Hive and Impala there are two ways.\nA. Manually get and put the files with the missing data from the Streamsets pipeline remdef directory **(Suggested Way)**\n  For each file:\n  1. From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with user `sdc` execute `sftp <sftp-user>@<sftp-server>:<sftp-path>`.\nor check via the corresponding [Grafana dashboard](https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/J4KPyBoVk/radius-dashboard?orgId=1&from=now-2d&to=now)\n  - Check the logs for the failed execution.\n- After the underlying problem has been corrected the next execution of the flow will load any files that have been delayed or failed to be loaded in a previous execution.\n- If the customer requests to load specific files after they have been processed by the flow. **In order to avoid duplicate data we have to reload the whole partition.**\n  - Ensure the files are still available on the SFTP server\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n  \n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n    # Check for files covering the whole date affected\n    sftp> ls -l *.LOADED\n    ```\n  \n  - Suspend coordinator `Radius_Load_Coordinator`\n  - Drop partitions that were not properly loaded from following tables\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n- If you are running the steps for the Primary skip this step\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n- For the previous day:\n  ``` bash\n  nohup /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/drop_hourly_partitions_STABLE.sh \"prod_trlog_online.service_audit_hourly\" \"`date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`\" >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/drop_hourly_partitions.log 2>&1 &\n  ```\n- For a specified date:\n  ``` bash\n  # e.g. 09-11-2019\n  nohup /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/drop_hourly_partitions_STABLE.sh \"prod_trlog_online.service_audit_hourly\" \"20191109\" >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/drop_hourly_partitions.log 2>&1 &\n  ```\n- Run the rest of the steps\n#### Execute aggregations\nThis flow computes aggregations for use with the [Queries](#queries).\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Script Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/update_online_aggr_tables.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/update_online_aggr_tables_STABLE.sh`\n**Alerts**:\n- Edit `/user/prometheus/flows/config/settings_prod.ini` and set `days_back` to the number of days back needed to reach the partition\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Workflows`:\n    - Search for `Prometheus-Import-Workflow` and filter for `failed`\n    - Re-run it\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `File Browser`:\n    - Edit `/user/prometheus/flows/config/settings_prod.ini` and restore `days_back` to `1`\n1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n- Go to logs and check both stdout and stderr\n- In case a partition has partially been inserted into the final table `prometheus.dwh22` and the error that caused the failure has been resolved:\n  From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Impala Editor`:\n    ``` sql\n    ALTER TABLE prometheus.dwh22 DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='<par_dt>');\n    ```\n  - For the previous day:\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Workflows`:\n    - Search for `Prometheus-Import-Workflow` and filter for `failed`\n    - Re-run it\n  - For the previous day:\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Workflows`:\n    - Search for `Prometheus-Import-Workflow` and filter for `failed`\n    - Re-run it\n  - For partitions older than yesterday:\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `File Browser`:\n    - Edit `/user/prometheus/flows/config/settings_prod.ini` and set `days_back` to the number of days back needed to reach the partition\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Workflows`:\n```\nEach archived file contains a set of logs related to the specific flow run (execution ID).  \nThe filename contains info about the `<partition data>` and the `<execution ID>`  \n`csiRedis.<partition data>.<execution ID>.tar.gz`\n3. Get the log file  \n- create a new dir to store the log file\n\t```\n\tmkdir -p /tmp/csi_redis_log\n\tcd /tmp/csi_redis_log\n\t```\n- Copy from the HDFS log dir the proper log file according to the `<execution ID>` mentioned in the alert email\n`hdfs dfs -get /user/rediscsi/log/csiRedis.20230401.20230401_102030.tar.gz`\n- Extract the archived log file\n`tar xvfz ${archFile} --strip-components 9 -C .`\n- Searches for Exception messages in log files  \n`egrep -i '(Exception:|Coused by)' *.log`  \n4. In case of failure, the flow will try to load the data in the next run.  \n\tjkl-Telecom is not aware of how the data files are produced or the contents in them.  \n\tThe Spark jobs that are used by the flow, have been developed by a partner of abc (an India company).",

Adjust `radius.trn` to use the `.dat.local` file for custom load.\n4. Ensure a dummy file older than the target exists in `/shared/radius_repo/cdrs`.\n5. Run:\n```bash\n/shared/abc/radius/DataParser/scripts/radius.pl -l -d -D -o\n/shared/abc/radius/bin/000_radius_ops.sh\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To recover the `radius.radarchive_hist` table when a file is missing or corrupted, you should first identify the system or service errors in the log file. If the failed execution's log contains a message indicating that the table does not contain new data, load the table first and then execute the script. Additionally, if files were missing, the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded. Before manually executing the script in this case, check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log. \n\n    To recover from a corrupted or missing file, you can also try to rename the file with the filename timestamp equal to the above-mentioned partition(s) and the same category, using SFTP. This will allow you to recover the data and continue with the execution of the script.\n\n    In summary, to recover the `radius.radarchive_hist` table when a file is missing or corrupted, you should identify system or service errors, load the table if necessary, check for automatically exported files, rename files using SFTP if necessary, and finally execute the script. \n\n    Note: The provided context does not explicitly mention the `radius.radarchive_hist` table, but it provides information on how to recover from missing or corrupted files in general. The answer is based on this general information and may need to be adapted to the specific situation. \n\n    Also note that some parts of the provided context seem to be unrelated to the question (e.g., the section about `export_csi_fix.sh`), but they have been taken into account in the answer in case they might be relevant. \n\n    Finally, please note that the provided context seems to be a mix of different topics and formats (e.g., code snippets, log messages, troubleshooting steps), which makes it difficult to provide a clear and concise answer.

        "chatbot_answer": " To fix corrupted statistics in Impala tables like `sai.sms_raw` and `brond.td_dslam_week`, you can use the `compute stats` command. This command recomputes table and column statistics, which are used by the Impala planner to generate efficient query plans.\n\n    For example, to compute statistics for the `sai.sms_raw` table, you would run the following command:\n    ```\ncompute incremental stats sai.sms_raw;\n```\n    Similarly, to compute statistics for the `brond.td_dslam_week` table, you would run the following command:\n    ```\ncompute incremental stats brond.td_dslam_week;\n```\n    Note that the `compute stats` command can be resource-intensive and may take some time to complete, depending on the size of the tables and the available resources.
