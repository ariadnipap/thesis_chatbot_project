        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve an Impala memory allocation error during a service audit enrichment job, you can take the following actions:\n1. **Check and adjust memory settings**: Ensure that the Impala daemon has sufficient memory allocated to it. You may need to adjust the `mem_limit` setting in the Impala configuration file.\n2. **Optimize queries and data processing**: Review the service audit enrichment job's queries and data processing steps to identify potential optimization opportunities. This could include rewriting queries to reduce memory usage, using more efficient data processing algorithms, or leveraging Impala's built-in features for optimizing query performance.\n3. **Increase the number of Impala nodes**: If the Impala cluster is experiencing high memory usage due to a large volume of data being processed, increasing the number of Impala nodes in the cluster can help distribute the workload and reduce memory pressure on individual nodes.\n4. **Monitor and adjust resource allocation**: Closely monitor the Impala cluster's resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory, disk I/O) and adjust resource allocation as needed to ensure that the cluster has sufficient resources to process the service audit enrichment job without encountering memory allocation errors.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can help resolve Impala memory allocation errors during service audit enrichment jobs and ensure that your data processing workflows run smoothly and efficiently.",

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check IPVPN-SM script and app [logs](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ipvpn_sm_replacement.md#logs)\n##### Load interface_metrics\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Impala Table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist]\n  B[Computation of IF KPIs]\n  C[Impala Table: bigcust.interface_metrics]\n  A -->|Query|B\n  B -->|Load|C\n```\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Impala Table**: `bigcust.interface_metrics`\n#### Inspect specific metric request\nIn case of alerts, we should first check the status of the particular requests on the monitoring DB.\nUsing the metric category and the reference interval associated with a request to IPVPN-SM App we can query the Monitoring DB\nby passing the corresponding job and operative_partition values.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4.

If any of the issues mentioned below happen, firstly follow the general troubleshooting steps to identify the problem that occurred and then follow the steps which correspond to fixing the issue. \n---\n#### Check file(s) has been loaded correctly\nLogin to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` and change to `sdc` user.\n1. Grep `A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline` for JVM errors:\n        ```\n        cat sdc.log | grep -i 'A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline'\n        ```\n        > ERROR ProductionPipelineRunnable - A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap     space java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n    1. Grep `ERROR` for any errors that might occur.\n```bash\n   cluster -> Streamsets -> Restart\n   ```\n4. Check Streamsets Process Options\n   ```bash\n   [root@un2 ~]# ps -ef | grep -i streamsets | grep -i xmx\n1. Open a pipeline. Check the generic summary (click anywhere in the board and select summary) to get an overview through dashboards on the data processed and errors. Also check if any job of the pipeline has errors (click on an action box and select tab Errors). Streamset will provide a specific ERROR message.\n**Step 2:** Look at the `logs`.\n**TO VIEW THE LOG FILE FOR A SPECIFIC PIPELINE:** `cat sdc.log | grep -i '<pipeline-grep-keyword>'`\nConcurrent Mark-Sweep GC\n   Heap Configuration:\n      MinHeapFreeRatio         = 40\n      MaxHeapFreeRatio         = 70\n      MaxHeapSize              = 34359738368 (32768.0MB)\n      NewSize                  = 2442723328 (2329.5625MB)\n      MaxNewSize               = 2442723328 (2329.5625MB)\n      OldSize                  = 31917015040 (30438.4375MB)\n      NewRatio                 = 2\n      SurvivorRatio            = 8\n      MetaspaceSize            = 21807104 (20.796875MB)",

Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n## Recommission\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors.

        "category": "Data Management & Query Execution",
        "ground_truth": "1. Initial failure was due to unreachable impalad: `sn102.bigdata.abc.gr:22000`, caused by a memory-hogging query.\n2. Later failures related to a missing HDFS file triggered a 'Disk I/O error'.\n3. After dev team corrected the reference config table, the flow resumed. No restart needed.\nUse Impala to verify availability of partitioned files and adjust load info if required.",
        "chatbot_answer": " ```\n\nTo determine the cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved, we need to follow a series of troubleshooting steps as outlined in the provided context.\n\n1. **Identify System or Service Errors**: The first step involves checking the log files for any system or service errors that might have occurred during the execution of the Location Mobility flow on 2023-04-19.\n\n2. **Check for Specific Error Messages**: After identifying potential system or service errors, the next step is to look for specific error messages within the log files that are associated with the failed execution of the Location Mobility flow.\n\n3. **Analyze Lock Files and SQL Scripts**: If the issue persists after checking the log files and error messages, the next step involves analyzing the lock files and SQL scripts associated with the Location Mobility flow. This analysis can help identify any potential issues with file locking or database queries that might have contributed to the failure of the Location Mobility flow.\n\n4. **Review Reconciliation Logs**: Finally, reviewing the reconciliation logs for the Location Mobility flow can provide valuable insights into how the issue was resolved. The reconciliation logs typically contain information about the files that were successfully exported and transferred to the exchange directory, as well as any errors or issues that were encountered during the process.\n\nBy following these troubleshooting steps and analyzing the relevant log files, error messages, lock files, SQL scripts, and reconciliation logs, it should be possible to determine the cause of the Location Mobility flow failure on 2023-04-19 and how it was resolved. \n\nHowever, without specific details about the failure, such as error messages or log entries, it's challenging to provide a precise answer to what caused the failure and how it was resolved.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, troubleshooting involves a detailed analysis of system logs, application logs, and sometimes network packet captures, depending on the nature of the issue. \n\nGiven the complexity and the variability of potential issues that could cause a flow like Location Mobility to fail, a comprehensive and step-by-step approach to troubleshooting is essential for identifying and resolving the root cause of the failure efficiently and effectively. \n```",

        "chatbot_answer": " To completely disable root SSH access on all nodes while ensuring scripts work with a substitute user, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a substitute user**: Create a new user on all nodes that will be used as a substitute for the root user. This user should have the necessary permissions to run the scripts.\n\n2. **Modify scripts to use the substitute user**: Update all scripts that currently use the root user to use the newly created substitute user instead.\n\n3. **Disable root SSH access**: Once all scripts have been updated to use the substitute user, you can disable root SSH access on all nodes. This can typically be done by setting the `PermitRootLogin` option to `no` in the SSH daemon configuration file (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that root SSH access is completely disabled on all nodes while still allowing scripts to run successfully using a substitute user.",

        "chatbot_answer": " The exported CPU and Memory metrics files are missing or delayed because the **Export** procedure, which is responsible for preparing the data in Oracle tables, may not be running frequently enough. Additionally, if 5 or more files weren't exported, the script needs to be executed with the `--max-files <N>` flag to catch up on the missed exports.\n\nTo reduce export latency, it's essential to ensure that the **Export** procedure is running at a frequency that meets the requirements of your system. Additionally, if you're experiencing issues with missing or delayed files, executing the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag can help catch up on any missed exports. \n\nIt's also important to monitor the system and adjust the frequency of the **Export** procedure as needed to ensure that export latency is minimized. \n\nBy taking these steps, you can help reduce export latency and ensure that your CPU and Memory metrics files are being exported in a timely manner. \n\nIn summary, to minimize export latency, ensure the **Export** procedure runs frequently enough, execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag if necessary, monitor the system, and adjust the frequency of the **Export** procedure as needed. \n\nBy following these steps, you can help reduce export latency and ensure that your CPU and Memory metrics files are being exported in a timely manner. \n\nIn conclusion, minimizing export latency is crucial for ensuring that your CPU and Memory metrics files are being exported in a timely manner.

Additionally, if 5 or more files weren't exported, the script needs to be executed with the `--max-files <N>` flag to catch up on the missed exports.\n\nTo reduce export latency, it's essential to ensure that the **Export** procedure is running at a frequency that meets the requirements of your system. Additionally, if you're experiencing issues with missing or delayed files, executing the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag can help catch up on any missed exports. \n\nIt's also important to monitor the system and adjust the frequency of the **Export** procedure as needed to ensure that export latency is minimized. \n\nBy taking these steps, you can help reduce export latency and ensure that your CPU and Memory metrics files are being exported in a timely manner. \n\nIn summary, to minimize export latency, ensure the **Export** procedure runs frequently enough, execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag if necessary, monitor the system, and adjust the frequency of the **Export** procedure as needed.

        "chatbot_answer": " To fix corrupted statistics in Impala tables like `sai.sms_raw` and `brond.td_dslam_week`, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Check for corrupted data**: Before fixing the statistics, ensure that there are no corrupted data in the tables. You can check for corrupted data by running queries on the tables.\n\n2. **Run the `COMPUTE STATS` command**: To fix corrupted statistics in Impala tables, you can run the `COMPUTE STATS` command on the affected tables. This command will recompute the statistics for the table.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nCOMPUTE STATS sai.sms_raw;\nCOMPUTE STATS brond.td_dslam_week;\n```\n3. **Verify the statistics**: After running the `COMPUTE STATS` command, verify that the statistics have been updated correctly.
