This can be done by modifying the `SPARK_DAEMON_MEMORY` environment variable or by adding the `-Xmx` option to the `SPARK_HISTORY_OPTS` environment variable. For example, you can add the following line to the `spark-defaults.conf` file: `spark.history.opts=-Xmx16384m`.

        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase', you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the logs**: Look for any errors or warnings in the logs that may indicate the cause of the concurrency issue.\n\n2. **Verify HBase quotas**: Check if there are any HBase quotas set that may be causing the concurrency issue. You can use the `hbase shell` command to check and modify HBase quotas.\n\n3. **Adjust Impala settings**: If you find that the concurrency issue is caused by Impala settings, you can try adjusting these settings to improve performance. For example, you can increase the number of Impala daemons or adjust the memory allocation for each daemon.\n\n4. **Optimize Upsert to HBase**: Finally, you can try optimizing the 'Upsert to HBase' operation itself. This may involve adjusting the batch size or the number of threads used for the upsert operation.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for your job using 'Upsert to HBase'.",

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

After tablets restart, retry the table creation query.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve a Kudu table creation error due to a 'Thrift SASL frame too long' error, you can try increasing the maximum allowed frame size in the Kudu configuration. This can be done by setting the `kudu.rpc.max_frame_size` property to a higher value, such as 1048576 (1MB). You can also try increasing the `kudu.tserver.negotiation.buffer.size` property to a higher value, such as 65536 (64KB). It's recommended to test these changes in a non-production environment before applying them to your production cluster. Additionally, you can also try to disable SASL authentication for Kudu, by setting the `kudu.security.authentication.sasl.enabled` property to false. However, this should be done with caution and only if you have a good understanding of the security implications.     ```sql\n    ALTER TABLE <database>.<table> DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala (older than 10 days are in impala), do: `ALTER table <database>.<table> DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt = '<date>')`, where `<date>` the date of partition to be dropped.\n\n    ```sql\n    ALTER TABLE <database>.<table> DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt = '<date>');\n    ```\n**Step 3:** In `Hue` as `intra`, create new partitions that overlap with the required interval from kudu table and/or from impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `ALTER TABLE <database>.<table> ADD RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`, where v1 and v2 the range of partitions.\n\n    ```sql\n    ALTER TABLE <database>.<table> ADD RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `ALTER TABLE <database>.<table> ADD PARTITION (par_dt = '<date>')`, where `<date>` the date of partition to be added.\n\n    ```sql\n    ALTER TABLE <database>.<table> ADD PARTITION (par_dt = '<date>');\n    ```\n**Step 4:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a Merge statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `UPSERT INTO TABLE <database>.<table> AS target SELECT * FROM <database>.<source_table> AS source WHERE source.par_dt = '<date>';`, where `<date>` the date of partition to be merged.\n\n    ```sql\n    UPSERT INTO TABLE <database>.<table> AS target \n    SELECT * \n    FROM <database>.<source_table> AS source \n    WHERE source.par_dt = '<date>';\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `UPSERT INTO TABLE <database>.<table> AS target SELECT * FROM <database>.<source_table> AS source WHERE source.par_dt = '<date>';`, where `<date>` the date of partition to be merged.\n\n    ```sql\n    UPSERT INTO TABLE <database>.<table> AS target \n    SELECT * \n    FROM <database>.<source_table> AS source \n    WHERE source.par_dt = '<date>';\n    ```\n**Step 5:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a refresh statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `REFRESH <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    REFRESH <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `INVALIDATE METADATA <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    INVALIDATE METADATA <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n**Step 6:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a compute stats statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n**Step 7:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a refresh statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `REFRESH <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    REFRESH <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `INVALIDATE METADATA <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    INVALIDATE METADATA <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n**Step 8:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a compute stats statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n**Step 9:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a refresh statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `REFRESH <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    REFRESH <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `INVALIDATE METADATA <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    INVALIDATE METADATA <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n**Step 10:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a compute stats statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n**Step 11:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a refresh statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `REFRESH <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    REFRESH <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `INVALIDATE METADATA <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    INVALIDATE METADATA <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n**Step 12:** In `Hue` as `intra`, run a compute stats statement on kudu table and/or on impala table. \n  - If it is in kudu, do: `COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;`.\n\n    ```sql\n    COMPUTE STATS <database>.<table>;\n    ```\n  - If it is in impala, do: `",

However, it provides general information about the EEMS data file feed, its components, records, and database queries. Additionally, it mentions common problems and ways to fix them, but these are related to specific issues such as \"No raw files found\" rather than disk replacement or recovery.\n\n    Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no specific information available about handling and recovering from a failed disk replacement on a DataNode (dr1node02) in HDFS. \n\n    However, general best practices for handling disk failures in HDFS include:\n\n    1. Monitoring disk health: Regularly monitoring disk health using tools like `hdfs dfsadmin -report` can help identify potential issues before they become critical.\n\n    2. Replacing failed disks: When a disk fails, it should be replaced as soon as possible to minimize data loss and ensure continued system availability.\n\n    3. Running HDFS rebalancing: After replacing a failed disk, it's essential to run HDFS rebalancing to ensure that data is evenly distributed across all available disks.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can help ensure the reliability and availability of your HDFS cluster, even in the event of disk failures. \n\nHowever, please note that these are general recommendations and may not be specific to your particular use case or environment. It's always a good idea to consult with a qualified Hadoop administrator or engineer for personalized guidance and support. \n\nIn summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about handling and recovering from a failed disk replacement on a DataNode (dr1node02) in HDFS, general best practices such as monitoring disk health, replacing failed disks, running HDFS rebalancing, and consulting with qualified Hadoop administrators or engineers can help ensure the reliability and availability of your HDFS cluster. \n\nTherefore, to handle and recover from a failed disk replacement on a DataNode (dr1node02) in HDFS, you should follow general best practices such as monitoring disk health, replacing failed disks, running HDFS rebalancing, and consulting with qualified Hadoop administrators or engineers. \n\nBy following these best practices, you can help ensure the reliability and availability of your HDFS cluster, even in the event of disk failures. \n\nHowever, please note that these are general recommendations and may not be specific to your particular use case or environment.

        "ground_truth": "Ensure the correct number of partitions is used. In the case of the Online MergeBatch job, 468 partitions caused timeout errors. It was fixed by adjusting to 180 partitions for `prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream` and deleting unnecessary Kudu disk data.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs, you can consider the following options:\n\n1. **Increase the timeout value**: You can increase the timeout value for Kudu scans in your Spark configuration. This will give the Kudu scan more time to complete before timing out.\n\n2. **Optimize your Kudu table schema**: Make sure that your Kudu table schema is optimized for query performance. This includes choosing the right data types, using efficient primary keys, and avoiding unnecessary columns.\n\n3. **Increase the number of Kudu tablets**: If you have a high-volume Kudu table, increasing the number of tablets can help spread the load and reduce the likelihood of scan timeouts.\n\n4. **Use Kudu's parallel scan feature**: Kudu provides a parallel scan feature that allows you to split a scan into multiple smaller scans that can be executed in parallel. This can help improve scan performance and reduce the likelihood of timeouts.\n\n5. **Monitor your Kudu cluster's performance**: Keep an eye on your Kudu cluster's performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. This can help you identify potential performance bottlenecks and take corrective action before they cause scan timeouts.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs and improve the overall performance and reliability of your data processing pipeline.",

The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n- Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/update_customer_sla_config.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log file.\n## Output Performance Data\nFor every 5-minute interval 5 HTTP requests containing CPU load, memory utilization, QoS, availability and interface utilization are sent to SQM server containing instanenous metrics for network elements and are moved to an exchange directory. Also these metrics are stored into an Impala table.\n### CPU and Memory\n#### Main script\nA procedure is executed periodically that triggers IPVPN-SM App to compute and transmit to the SQM server via HTTP the metrics for CPU and memory KPIs of the network elements. The procedure also inserts the KPIs into an Impala table. These three sub-steps are executed in parallel.\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Scheduler**: `Cron`\n**Schedule**: `Every 5 minutes`\n**Exchange user**: `saismpm`\n**Exchange path**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm`\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check IPVPN-SM script and app [logs](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ipvpn_sm_replacement.md#logs)\n##### Load interface_metrics\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Impala Table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist]\n  B[Computation of IF KPIs]\n  C[Impala Table: bigcust.interface_metrics]\n  A -->|Query|B\n  B -->|Load|C\n```\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Impala Table**: `bigcust.interface_metrics`\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/populate_interface_metrics_table.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/populate_interface_metrics_table.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log files e.g failed Impala query.\n## Output Configuration Data\nPeriodically an XML file that contains information about VPN customers with configuration changes, is produced by one of the Wildfly instances and is transferred to an exchange directory using a shell script.\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/populate_components_metrics_table.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/populate_components_metrics_table.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log files e.g failed Impala query.\n### QoS and Availability\n#### Main script\nA procedure is executed periodically that triggers IPVPN-SM App to compute and transmit to the SQM server via HTTP the metrics for QoS and availability KPIs of the network elements. The procedure also inserts the KPIs into an Impala table. These three sub-steps are executed in parallel.\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Scheduler**: `Cron`\n**Schedule**: `Every 5 minutes`\n**Exchange user**: `saismpm`\n**Exchange path**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm`\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/initiate_export_sla.cron.`date '+%Y%m%d'`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_sla.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:",

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1.

        "chatbot_answer": " The process for replacing hardware on a BigStreamer node and contacting Dell support involves several steps. \n\n1. First, you need to decommission the node from Cloudera Manager by entering maintenance mode, decommissioning roles, and taking the datanode role offline if present.\n\n2. Next, you should check for non-default InfiniBand partitions as described in the Oracle documentation.\n\n3. After replacing the hardware, such as an IB card, which requires powering off the host, you need to perform some configurations on the interfaces and roles before recommissioning them.\n\n4. To contact Dell support, you first need to open a ticket. This involves finding the management IP address of the IDRAC using ipmitool, then connecting via VNC and opening Firefox to access the IDRAC web interface.\n\n5. From the IDRAC web interface, you can find the service tag number under Server Information, which is required when calling Dell support.\n\n6. Once you have the service tag number, you can call Dell support at the provided phone number and follow their instructions to create a case and proceed with the necessary steps for resolving the issue or collecting TSR logs from IDRAC if required. \n\nIt's also important to inform \"abc\" before taking any action on the IDRAC. \n\nIn case of any issues or failures during the process, troubleshooting steps should be followed as outlined in the provided documentation, which may include checking monitoring status, writing down Exec_id values from alert emails, and following specific procedures for managing and troubleshooting the monitoring application. \n\nOverall, replacing hardware on a BigStreamer node and contacting Dell support requires careful planning, execution, and troubleshooting to ensure successful resolution of issues and minimal downtime.",

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\n...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n    ```log\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n    Now replication works.\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```",

This will help you identify if a duplicate job has already been submitted.\n\n3. **Implement idempotent workflows**: Design your workflows to be idempotent, meaning that running the same workflow multiple times with the same inputs will produce the same output without causing any unintended side effects.\n\n4. **Use locking mechanisms**: Consider implementing locking mechanisms, such as using a distributed lock or a semaphore, to prevent multiple instances of the same workflow from running concurrently.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively diagnose and prevent duplicate job submissions in CDSW for scheduled workflows like 'Set_Point_Automation'.",

Ensure that these scripts are tested thoroughly to confirm they work as expected with the new user.\n\n3. **Disable Root SSH Access**: Once all scripts have been updated and tested, disable root SSH access on all nodes. This can typically be done by editing the SSH configuration file (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) and setting the `PermitRootLogin` directive to `no`.

Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n# Energy-Efficiency Pollaploi\n## Overview\nThis is an `Oozie Flow` responsible to **load data** from **txt files** into **impala tables**.

        "category": "Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution",
        "ground_truth": "Use Impala shell to recompute or refresh statistics:\n```sql\ncompute stats sai.sms_raw;\nrefresh sai.sms_raw;\n```\nIf compute fails, use refresh instead. Avoid running compute stats on live-updated partitions, as they receive data every 5 minutes. For production-quality statistics, a dedicated project should be scoped.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To fix corrupted statistics in Impala tables like `sai.sms_raw` and `brond.td_dslam_week`, you can use the `compute stats` command in Impala. This command recalculates the statistics for a table, which can help improve query performance.\n\n    For example, to compute statistics for the `sai.sms_raw` table, you would run the following command:\n    ```\n    compute incremental stats sai.sms_raw;\n    ```\n\n    Similarly, to compute statistics for the `brond.td_dslam_week` table, you would run the following command:\n    ```\n    compute incremental stats brond.td_dslam_week;\n    ```\n\n\n    It's generally a good idea to compute statistics regularly, especially after loading new data into a table. This can help ensure that queries are optimized correctly and run efficiently.\n\n\n    Additionally, you can use the `refresh` command to refresh the metadata for a table, which can also help resolve issues with corrupted statistics.\n\n\n    For example:\n    ```\n    refresh sai.sms_raw;\n    ```\n\n\n    By using these commands, you should be able to fix corrupted statistics in your Impala tables and improve query performance.",
