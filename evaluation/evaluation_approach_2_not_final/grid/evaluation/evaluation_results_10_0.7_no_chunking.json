        "category": "Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution",
        "ground_truth": "To resolve the EXPORT job failure due to a duplicate key, first check for duplicate entries in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg` using Impala Shell. Then, create backup and temp tables, remove the duplicate entry by ID and timestamp, and overwrite the original table. Finally, rerun the export script:\\n```bash\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " The correct procedure to resolve a failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the cause of failure**: Use the UC4 agent script logs and sqoop logs to identify the cause of the failure, which in this case is a duplicate key in the loan payment data.\n\n2. **Resolve the issue**: Resolve the issue by removing or updating the duplicate records in the loan payment data.\n\n3. **Communicate with MNO UC4 administrators**: Communicate with MNO UC4 administrators to rerun the job if you fixed the problem.\n\n4. **Rerun the job (if necessary)**: If the MNO UC4 administrators ask you to rerun the job, then do so using the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t payment\n    ```\n    For a specified date, use the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -d <date> -t payment\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data.",

        "chatbot_answer": " The provided context does not directly address the causes of a YARN Node Manager failure or how it can be mitigated. However, it provides information on various system components, logs, and troubleshooting steps for different users and applications.\n\n     To answer the question based on general knowledge of YARN and Hadoop ecosystems:\n\n     A YARN Node Manager failure can be caused by various factors such as resource constraints (e.g., memory or CPU), configuration issues, network connectivity problems, or software bugs.\n\n     To mitigate such failures, several strategies can be employed:\n     1. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement comprehensive monitoring of the YARN Node Managers and set up alerts for potential issues before they lead to failures.\n     2. **Resource Management**: Ensure that each Node Manager has sufficient resources (memory, CPU) allocated to it. Adjust resource allocations as needed based on workload demands.\n     3. **Configuration and Maintenance**: Regularly review and update configurations to ensure they are optimal for the current workload and system environment. Perform routine maintenance tasks such as cleaning up logs and temporary files to prevent storage issues.\n     4. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure that all nodes in the cluster have stable network connectivity. Any network issues can lead to communication failures between nodes, potentially causing Node Manager failures.\n     5. **Software Updates and Bug Fixes**: Keep the Hadoop and YARN software up to date with the latest patches and bug fixes. This can help prevent failures due to known software issues.\n\n     By implementing these strategies, the likelihood and impact of YARN Node Manager failures can be significantly reduced, contributing to a more stable and reliable Hadoop ecosystem.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve Kerberos authentication issues on RHEL 8 for a new Way4Streams installation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Kerberos Configuration**: Ensure that the Kerberos configuration file (`/etc/krb5.conf`) is correctly configured for your realm.\n\n2. **Obtain a Kerberos Ticket**: Use the `kinit` command to obtain a Kerberos ticket for the principal that will be used by Way4Streams.\n\n3. **Configure Way4Streams for Kerberos Authentication**: Modify the Way4Streams configuration files to enable Kerberos authentication. This may involve specifying the Kerberos realm, the service principal name, and other relevant settings.\n\n4. **Test Kerberos Authentication**: Once the configuration changes have been made, test the Kerberos authentication by attempting to access Way4Streams using a Kerberos-enabled client.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve Kerberos authentication issues on RHEL 8 for a new Way4Streams installation.",
        "retrieved_context": "```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication.

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Check IPVPN-SM script and app [logs](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ipvpn_sm_replacement.md#logs)\n##### Load interface_metrics\n``` mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A[Impala Table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist]\n  B[Computation of IF KPIs]\n  C[Impala Table: bigcust.interface_metrics]\n  A -->|Query|B\n  B -->|Load|C\n```\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n**Impala Table**: `bigcust.interface_metrics`\n#### Inspect specific metric request\nIn case of alerts, we should first check the status of the particular requests on the monitoring DB.\nUsing the metric category and the reference interval associated with a request to IPVPN-SM App we can query the Monitoring DB\nby passing the corresponding job and operative_partition values.\n3.

If any of the issues mentioned below happen, firstly follow the general troubleshooting steps to identify the problem that occurred and then follow the steps which correspond to fixing the issue. \n---\n#### Check file(s) has been loaded correctly\nLogin to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` and change to `sdc` user.\n1. Grep `A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline` for JVM errors:\n        ```\n        cat sdc.log | grep -i 'A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline'\n        ```\n        > ERROR ProductionPipelineRunnable - A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap     space java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n    1. Grep `ERROR` for any errors that might occur.\n```bash\n   cluster -> Streamsets -> Restart\n   ```\n4. Check Streamsets Process Options\n   ```bash\n   [root@un2 ~]# ps -ef | grep -i streamsets | grep -i xmx\n1. Open a pipeline. Check the generic summary (click anywhere in the board and select summary) to get an overview through dashboards on the data processed and errors. Also check if any job of the pipeline has errors (click on an action box and select tab Errors). Streamset will provide a specific ERROR message.\n**Step 2:** Look at the `logs`.\n**TO VIEW THE LOG FILE FOR A SPECIFIC PIPELINE:** `cat sdc.log | grep -i '<pipeline-grep-keyword>'`\nConcurrent Mark-Sweep GC\n   Heap Configuration:\n      MinHeapFreeRatio         = 40\n      MaxHeapFreeRatio         = 70\n      MaxHeapSize              = 34359738368 (32768.0MB)\n      NewSize                  = 2442723328 (2329.5625MB)\n      MaxNewSize               = 2442723328 (2329.5625MB)\n      OldSize                  = 31917015040 (30438.4375MB)\n      NewRatio                 = 2\n      SurvivorRatio            = 8\n      MetaspaceSize            = 21807104 (20.796875MB)",

        "chatbot_answer": " To repair OpenLDAP replication between kerb1 and kerb2 if the Manager password has changed, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Login to kerb1 as root**: Use `ssh kerb1` and then `sudo -i` to gain root access.\n\n2. **Backup your current configuration**: Run `slapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif` and `slapcat -n 2 -l data.ldif` to create backups of your configuration and data.\n\n3. **Create a new slapd password**: Use the command `slappasswd -h {SSHA}` to generate a new password hash.\n\n4. **Store the output**: The output will start with `{SSHA}xxxxxxx`. Store this value as it will be used in the next steps.\n\n5. **Create an LDIF file for changing the password**: Create a file named `changepwconfig.ldif` and add the necessary configuration to change the Manager password.\n\n6. **Modify the replication configuration**: Use the command `ldapmodify -H ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=config\" -W -f replication_config.ldif` to modify the replication configuration with the new password.\n\n7. **Repeat the modification on kerb2**: Run the same `ldapmodify` command but with the URL pointing to `kerb2`.\n\n8. **Verify the replication status**: After making these changes, verify that the replication is working correctly by checking for any errors in the logs and ensuring that data is being replicated between `kerb1` and `kerb2`. \n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to repair OpenLDAP replication between `kerb1` and `kerb2` after changing the Manager password.",

        "chatbot_answer": " The error 'Engine exited with status 34' on jobs in CDSW is caused by a timeout issue. This can occur when the engine takes too long to execute a task, resulting in the engine exiting with a non-zero status code.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try increasing the timeout value for the engine. This can be done by modifying the configuration settings for the engine. Additionally, you can also try optimizing the tasks being executed by the engine to reduce the execution time and prevent timeouts from occurring.\n\nIn terms of specific steps, you can follow these general guidelines:\n\n1. Identify the engine configuration settings that control the timeout value.\n2. Modify the configuration settings to increase the timeout value.\n3. Restart the engine or redeploy the application to apply the changes.\n4. Monitor the engine's performance and adjust the timeout value as needed to prevent timeouts from occurring.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error 'Engine exited with status 34' on jobs in CDSW by increasing the timeout value for the engine.",

        "chatbot_answer": " ```\n\nI'm happy to help you with your question. However, I must point out that the context provided does not contain any information about a failure of the Location Mobility flow on 2023-04-19.\n\nIf you could provide more context or clarify what you are looking for, I would be happy to try and assist you further. \n\nIn general, to troubleshoot issues with the Location Mobility flow, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the logs: Look for any error messages in the logs that may indicate what caused the failure.\n2. Check the lock files: If the flow is using lock files to prevent concurrent executions, check if the lock file is present and if it is causing the flow to fail.\n3. Check the SQL scripts: If the flow is using SQL scripts to extract data, check if the SQL scripts are correct and if they are executing successfully.\n4. Check the SFTP configuration: If the flow is using SFTP to transfer files, check if the SFTP configuration is correct and if the files are being transferred successfully.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with. \n```# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **The context provided does not contain any information about a failure of the Location Mobility flow on 2023-04-19**.\n2. To troubleshoot issues with the Location Mobility flow, one should follow these steps: \n    * Check the logs for any error messages that may indicate what caused the failure.\n    * Check the lock files to see if they are present and causing the flow to fail.\n    * Check the SQL scripts to ensure they are correct and executing successfully.\n    * Check the SFTP configuration to ensure it is correct and files are being transferred successfully.\n\n# Fixed solution:\nSince there's no specific code or logs provided related to the failure on 2023-04-19, I'll provide a general template for troubleshooting steps in a Python script. This example assumes you're checking log files for errors:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport re\n\ndef check_log_files(log_file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks log files for error messages.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    log_file_path (str): Path to the log file.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A list of error messages found in the log file.\n    \"\"\"\n    error_messages = []\n    try:\n        with open(log_file_path, 'r') as file:\n            for line in file:\n                # Use regular expression to match error messages\n                if re.search(r'ERROR|Exception', line):\n                    error_messages.append(line.strip())\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Log file {log_file_path} not found.\")\n    \n    return error_messages\n\n# Example usage\nlog_file_path = \"/path/to/log/file.log\"\nerror_messages = check_log_files(log_file_path)\nif error_messages:\n    print(\"Error messages found in the log file:\")\n    for message in error_messages:\n        print(message)\nelse:\n    print(\"No error messages found in the log file.\")\n```\n\n# Explanation of changes:\n*   **Added a Python function `check_log_files` to check log files for error messages**. This function takes the path to the log file as input and returns a list of error messages found in the log file.\n*   **Used regular expressions to match error messages in the log file**. The regular expression pattern used is `r'ERROR|Exception'`, which matches any line containing the words \"ERROR\" or \"Exception\".\n*   **Provided example usage of the `check_log_files` function**, including how to call the function with a specific log file path and how to print the list of error messages returned by the function.\n\n# Tests and example uses:\nTo test the `check_log_files` function, you can create a sample log file containing some error messages and then call the function with the path to this log file. For example:\n\n```python\n# Create a sample log file\nwith open(\"sample.log\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.write(\"2023-04-19 10:00:00 ERROR This is an error message.\\n\")\n    file.write(\"2023-04-19 10:01:00 INFO This is an info message.\\n\")\n    file.write(\"2023-04-19 10:02:00 EXCEPTION This is an exception message.\\n\")\n\n# Call the check_log_files function with the path to the sample log file\nerror_messages = check_log_files(\"sample.log\")\n\n# Print the list of error messages returned by the function\nif error_messages:\n    print(\"Error messages found in the log file:\")\n    for message in error_messages:\n        print(message)\nelse:\n    print(\"No error messages found in the log file.\")\n```",

This might involve reloading data into your pipeline or rerunning jobs that failed due to corrupted data.\n\n5. **Implement Preventative Measures**: Once you've resolved the immediate issue, consider what preventative measures you can implement to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future. This could include more rigorous validation of incoming data, regular integrity checks on stored data, or improvements to your data processing pipelines to make them more resilient to errors.\n\nBy following these steps and adapting them based on the specifics of your situation and the tools you're using, you should be able to effectively handle stale metadata issues or corrupted Parquet files in `osix.sip`.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To completely disable root SSH access on all nodes while ensuring scripts work with a substitute user, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a substitute user**: Create a new user on all nodes that will be used as a substitute for the root user. This user should have the necessary permissions to run the scripts.\n\n2. **Modify scripts to use the substitute user**: Update all scripts that currently use the root user to use the newly created substitute user instead.\n\n3. **Disable root SSH access**: Once all scripts have been updated to use the substitute user, you can disable root SSH access on all nodes. This can typically be done by setting the `PermitRootLogin` option to `no` in the SSH daemon configuration file (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that root SSH access is completely disabled on all nodes while still allowing scripts to run successfully using a substitute user.",

        "chatbot_answer": " The exported CPU and Memory metrics files may be missing or delayed due to various reasons such as system or service errors, network issues, or data processing delays. \n\nTo reduce export latency, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Monitor system and service logs**: Regularly check the system and service logs to identify any errors or issues that may be causing the delay.\n2. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure that the network connection between the systems involved in the export process is stable and functioning correctly.\n3. **Optimize data processing**: Review the data processing workflow and optimize it to reduce processing time. This may involve improving data filtering, aggregation, or transformation processes.\n4. **Implement automated monitoring and alerting**: Set up automated monitoring and alerting systems to quickly detect any issues or delays in the export process. This will enable prompt investigation and resolution of problems.\n5. **Consider implementing a message queue or buffer**: If the export process involves transferring large amounts of data, consider implementing a message queue or buffer to temporarily store the data. This can help reduce the load on the systems involved in the export process and minimize the risk of data loss or corruption.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help identify and address the root causes of missing or delayed exported CPU and Memory metrics files, ultimately reducing export latency and improving overall system performance. \n\nIn addition to the above steps, if 5 or more files weren't exported, execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag to instruct the script to catch-up, meaning to export files for N 2-hour intervals.\n\nIt is also important to note that before manually executing the script in case of missing files, check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log. \n\nBy following these guidelines and taking a proactive approach to monitoring and optimizing the export process, you can help ensure that CPU and Memory metrics files are exported correctly and in a timely manner. \n\nIn summary, to reduce export latency and address issues with missing or delayed exported CPU and Memory metrics files, follow these key steps: \n\n1.

Also these metrics are stored into an Impala table.\n### CPU and Memory\n#### Main script\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files\nThe source system in this case is NNM. For high availability there are two instances of NNM on two seperate servers and they operate in active-standby fashion. The whole infrastructure is entirely managed by abc. The raw files produced contain component metrics for CPU load and memory usage of the network elements and are stored in local paths on those servers.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n```\n  Ndef: We are interesting for the 1st row only `EXPORT_SEQUENCE=0`  \n### Phased\n1.
