        "category": "Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution",
        "ground_truth": "To resolve the EXPORT job failure due to a duplicate key, first check for duplicate entries in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg` using Impala Shell. Then, create backup and temp tables, remove the duplicate entry by ID and timestamp, and overwrite the original table. Finally, rerun the export script:\\n```bash\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " The correct procedure to resolve a failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the cause of failure**: Use the UC4 agent script logs and sqoop logs to identify the cause of the failure, which in this case is a duplicate key in the loan payment data.\n\n2. **Resolve the issue**: Remove or update the duplicate records in the loan payment data to resolve the issue.\n\n3. **Rerun the job**: Once the issue is resolved, communicate with the mno UC4 administrators to rerun the job. If they ask to rerun the job, then use the following command to rerun the job for the previous day:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t payment\n    ```\n    For a specified date, use the following command:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -d <date> -t payment\n    ```\n    Replace `<date>` with the desired date in the format `YYYYMMDD`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the failed EXPORT job and successfully export the loan payment data.",

        "ground_truth": "A Node Manager failure on pr1node01 was due to excessive disk usage from krb5kdc logs. These logs had grown to 80GB. The mitigation included deleting old logs and changing log rotation policy to weekly, keeping only 7 logs instead of 12.",
        "chatbot_answer": " The provided context does not directly address the causes of a YARN Node Manager failure or how it can be mitigated. However, it provides information on various logs and troubleshooting steps for different applications and services.\n\n     To answer the question based on general knowledge of YARN and Hadoop ecosystems:\n\n     A YARN Node Manager failure can be caused by various factors such as resource constraints (e.g., memory, CPU), configuration issues, network connectivity problems, or software bugs.\n\n     To mitigate a YARN Node Manager failure, several steps can be taken:\n     1. **Monitor Resources**: Ensure that the Node Manager has sufficient resources (memory, CPU) to operate effectively.\n     2. **Review Configuration**: Verify that the YARN and Node Manager configurations are correct and appropriate for the cluster's workload and size.\n     3. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that there are no network connectivity issues between the Node Manager and other components of the Hadoop ecosystem, such as the Resource Manager or DataNodes.\n     4. **Apply Software Updates**: Keep the YARN and Hadoop software up to date with the latest patches and updates, which often include bug fixes and performance improvements.\n     5. **Implement Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems for the YARN Node Manager and other critical components of the Hadoop ecosystem. This will help in quickly identifying and responding to issues before they escalate into more serious problems.\n\n    By following these steps, you can mitigate YARN Node Manager failures and ensure the reliability and performance of your Hadoop cluster.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase', you can consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Monitor and Adjust Quotas**: Regularly monitor the HBase quotas and adjust them as necessary to prevent overloading and concurrency issues.\n\n2. **Optimize Upsert Operations**: Optimize the upsert operations in your Impala job to minimize the load on HBase. This could involve batching updates, using more efficient data types, or leveraging Impala's built-in optimization features.\n\n3. **Implement Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry mechanisms in your Impala job to handle transient failures that may occur due to concurrency issues or quota limitations.\n\n4. **Consider Horizontal Scaling**: If the concurrency issues persist despite optimizations and retry mechanisms, consider horizontally scaling your HBase cluster to increase its capacity to handle concurrent upsert operations.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase'.    ```bash\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => WRITE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '1000req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Run performance tests with write quotas\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n## Remove write quotas and set read quotas\n- Remove write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '1000req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Remove HBase quotas from a namespace\n1. ssh to an edge node\n2. kinit as hbase\n   ```bash\n   cd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/processes\n   ls \u2013ltr HBASE\n   cd <latest hbase process folder>\n   kinit -kt hbase.keytab `hostname`\n   ```\n3. Remove quotas from the namespace\n   ```bash\n   hbase shell\n   set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n   list_quotas\n   ```\n\n## Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **Impala Concurrency Issues**: The job using 'Upsert to HBase' is experiencing concurrency issues related to HBase quotas.\n2. **HBase Quota Limitations**: The current HBase quota settings are limiting the performance of the Impala job, leading to concurrency issues.\n3. **Need for Optimization and Retry Mechanisms**: To resolve the concurrency issues, there is a need to optimize the upsert operations in the Impala job and implement retry mechanisms to handle transient failures.\n\n## Fixed solution:\nTo resolve the Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas, you can consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Monitor and Adjust Quotas**: Regularly monitor the HBase quotas and adjust them as necessary to prevent overloading and concurrency issues.\n2. **Optimize Upsert Operations**: Optimize the upsert operations in your Impala job to minimize the load on HBase. This could involve batching updates, using more efficient data types, or leveraging Impala's built-in optimization features.\n3. **Implement Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry mechanisms in your Impala job to handle transient failures that may occur due to concurrency issues or quota limitations.\n4. **Consider Horizontal Scaling**: If the concurrency issues persist despite optimizations and retry mechanisms, consider horizontally scaling your HBase cluster to increase its capacity to handle concurrent upsert operations.\n\n## Explanation of changes:\n*   **Monitoring and Adjusting Quotas**: Regular monitoring and adjustment of HBase quotas can help prevent overloading and concurrency issues.\n*   **Optimizing Upsert Operations**: Optimizing upsert operations in the Impala job can minimize the load on HBase, reducing the likelihood of concurrency issues.\n*   **Implementing Retry Mechanisms**: Implementing retry mechanisms in the Impala job can handle transient failures that may occur due to concurrency issues or quota limitations.\n*   **Considering Horizontal Scaling**: If concurrency issues persist despite optimizations and retry mechanisms, considering horizontal scaling of the HBase cluster can increase its capacity to handle concurrent upsert operations.\n\n## Tests and example uses:\nTo test the effectiveness of the proposed solution, you can perform the following tests:\n\n1.  **Baseline Test**: Run the Impala job with the current HBase quota settings and measure the performance metrics such as execution time, throughput, and error rate.\n2.  **Optimization Test**: Apply the optimization techniques such as batching updates, using more efficient data types, or leveraging Impala's built-in optimization features to the Impala job. Run the optimized job with the same HBase quota settings as the baseline test and measure the performance metrics.\n3.  **Retry Mechanism Test**: Implement retry mechanisms in the Impala job to handle transient failures that may occur due to concurrency issues or quota limitations. Run the job with the retry mechanisms enabled and measure the performance metrics.\n4.  **Horizontal Scaling Test**: If the concurrency issues persist despite optimizations and retry mechanisms, consider horizontally scaling the HBase cluster to increase its capacity to handle concurrent upsert operations. Run the Impala job on the scaled-up HBase cluster and measure the performance metrics.\n\nBy performing these tests, you can evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in resolving the Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas.    ```bash\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n\n    Question:\n    How can Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas be resolved for a job using 'Upsert to HBase'?\n\n    Now give me your response to the question based on the context provided:\n     To resolve Impala concurrency issues related to HBase quotas for a job using 'Upsert to HBase', you can consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Monitor and Adjust Quotas**: Regularly monitor the HBase quotas and adjust them as necessary to prevent overloading and concurrency issues.\n\n2. **Optimize Upsert Operations**: Optimize the upsert operations in your Impala job to minimize the load on HBase.

        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve Kerberos authentication issues on RHEL 8 for a new Way4Streams installation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Kerberos Configuration**: Ensure that the Kerberos configuration file (`/etc/krb5.conf`) is correctly configured for your realm.\n\n2. **Obtain a Kerberos Ticket**: Use the `kinit` command to obtain a Kerberos ticket for the principal that will be used by Way4Streams.\n\n3. **Configure Way4Streams for Kerberos Authentication**: Modify the Way4Streams configuration files to enable Kerberos authentication. This may involve specifying the Kerberos realm, the service principal name, and other relevant settings.\n\n4. **Test Kerberos Authentication**: Once the configuration changes have been made, test the Kerberos authentication by attempting to access Way4Streams using a Kerberos-enabled client.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve Kerberos authentication issues on RHEL 8 for a new Way4Streams installation.",
        "retrieved_context": "```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication.

This approach allows you to process smaller chunks of data, reducing the load on Kudu and minimizing the likelihood of scan timeouts. Additionally, you can also adjust the values in the submit script to optimize the performance of the Spark job. \n\nFor example, you can run the following command to process a specific time range:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2019-11-09 00:00:00\" \"2019-11-09 12:00:00\"\n```\nBy processing smaller chunks of data, you can reduce the load on Kudu and minimize the likelihood of scan timeouts. \n\nAdditionally, you can also adjust the values in the submit script to optimize the performance of the Spark job.

These files are then parsed by one or more procedures. Finally they are loaded to BigStreamer cluster in Impala tables. There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files",

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective.

This is part of the Location Mobility (LM) process.\n\n2. **File Naming Convention**: The output files are named according to a specific convention, such as `LM_02_lte_yyyyMMdd_xxx.txt`, which indicates that it's an LTE-related file for Location Mobility.\n\n3. **Transfer to Exchange Directory**: After being generated and named appropriately, these files are transferred to an exchange directory. This directory serves as a central location where files can be exchanged between different systems or services.\n\n4. **Reading and Deletion by TrustCenter**: Once the files are in the exchange directory, they are read by the TrustCenter service. After reading the contents of these files, TrustCenter deletes them from the exchange directory. This process ensures that sensitive data is handled securely and efficiently.\n\n5. **Reconciliation Files**: Alongside the main data files, reconciliation files are also produced. These files contain metadata about the execution date, file name, export date, and the number of lines in the file. The purpose of these reconciliation files is to provide an additional layer of validation and auditing for the data transfer process.\n\nIn summary, the generation and validation of LTE data files for TrustCenter involve a series of steps that ensure the secure, efficient, and auditable exchange of sensitive data between different systems or services. \n     ```bash\n```python\nprint(\"The final answer is\")\nprint(\"The generation and validation of LTE data files for TrustCenter involve several steps.\")\nprint(\"1.

        "chatbot_answer": " The error 'Engine exited with status 34' on jobs in CDSW is caused by a timeout issue. This can occur when the engine takes too long to execute a task, resulting in the engine exiting with a non-zero status code.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try increasing the timeout value for the engine. This can be done by modifying the configuration settings for the engine. Additionally, you can also try optimizing the tasks being executed by the engine to reduce the execution time and prevent timeouts from occurring.\n\nIn terms of specific steps, you can follow these general guidelines:\n\n1. Identify the engine configuration settings that control the timeout value.\n2. Modify the configuration settings to increase the timeout value.\n3. Restart the engine or redeploy the application to apply the changes.\n4. Monitor the engine's performance and adjust the timeout value as needed to prevent timeouts from occurring.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error 'Engine exited with status 34' on jobs in CDSW by increasing the timeout value for the engine.",

However, it discusses various data processing and monitoring tasks, including loading data to Redis DB, monitoring connection details, and handling errors in Streamset pipelines.\n\nGiven the information available, if you encounter stale metadata issues or corrupted Parquet files in `osix.sip`, you might consider the following general steps based on the context provided:\n\n1. **Check Logs**: Look into the logs of your data processing pipeline to identify any error messages related to stale metadata or corrupted Parquet files.\n\n2. **Data Validation**: Validate the integrity of your Parquet files and metadata. This can involve checking for corruption, inconsistencies in metadata, or missing files.\n\n3. **Reprocessing Data**: If you find issues with your data, such as corruption or staleness, you may need to reprocess the affected data. This could involve reloading data from source systems, re-running data transformation jobs, or updating metadata.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly detect future instances of stale metadata or corrupted Parquet files. This can help minimize the impact of such issues on your data processing pipelines.\n\nBy following these steps, you can address stale metadata issues or corrupted Parquet files in `osix.sip`, although the specific details may vary depending on your particular use case and system configurations.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To reprocess RADIUS files for missing data during system downtime, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the missing data period**: Determine the time frame when the system was down and data was not collected.\n\n2. **Locate the corresponding RADIUS files**: Find the RADIUS files that correspond to the identified missing data period. These files are usually stored in a specific directory on the SFTP server.\n\n3. **Rename the files to be reprocessed**: Rename the located RADIUS files by removing any suffix that might indicate they have already been processed (e.g., `.LOADED`). This step is crucial because the system will only reprocess files that do not have a processed suffix.\n\n4. **Trigger the reprocessing workflow**: After renaming the files, trigger the workflow that is responsible for processing RADIUS files. This can usually be done through a scheduler like Apache Airflow or by manually triggering the workflow through a web interface or command line.\n\n5. **Monitor the reprocessing job**: Once the reprocessing workflow has been triggered, monitor the job to ensure it completes successfully. Check for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with the reprocessing job.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully reprocess RADIUS files for missing data during system downtime.",
