        "ground_truth": "To resolve the EXPORT job failure due to a duplicate key, first check for duplicate entries in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg` using Impala Shell. Then, create backup and temp tables, remove the duplicate entry by ID and timestamp, and overwrite the original table. Finally, rerun the export script:\\n```bash\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " The correct procedure to resolve a failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data is as follows:\n1. Use the UC4 agent script logs and sqoop logs to identify the cause of the failure.\n2. Check if the previous day was a business day. If not, the export job will not be executed.\n3. The script cleans up after failure, so if the problem was temporary, communicate with MNO UC4 administrators to rerun the job if you fixed the problem.\n4. To rerun the job for loan payment data, use the following command:\n``` bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\n```\nFor a specified date, add the `-p` option followed by the desired date in `YYYYMMDD` format. For example:\n``` bash\n# eg. 09-11-2019 (Ndef that the argument is one day after the desired date)\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment -p 20191109\n```\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the failed EXPORT job in DWH_IBank caused by a duplicate key in the loan payment data.",

        "question": "How can you resolve 'OutOfMemoryError' issues on the Spark History Server in Cloudera?",
        "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
        "ground_truth": "Inspect the logs on the node and confirm the Java heap size in Cloudera UI. If it is too low (e.g., 512M), increase it to a higher value like 2G to match the configuration of similar roles on other nodes. Then restart the role.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve 'OutOfMemoryError' issues on the Spark History Server in Cloudera, you can try increasing the Java heap size for the Spark History Server. This can be done by modifying the `SPARK_DAEMON_MEMORY` environment variable or by adding the `-Xmx` option to the `SPARK_HISTORY_OPTS` environment variable. For example, you can add the following line to the `spark-defaults.conf` file: `spark.history.opts=-Xmx16384m`. After making these changes, you should restart the Spark History Server for the changes to take effect. \n\n    Additionally, you can also try to reduce the number of applications that are being stored in the Spark History Server. This can be done by modifying the `spark.history.fs.cleaner.enabled` property to `true` and setting the `spark.history.fs.cleaner.interval` property to a suitable value (e.g. 1d). This will enable the Spark History Server to periodically clean up old application logs, which can help to reduce the memory usage of the Spark History Server.\n\n    It's also worth noting that you can monitor the memory usage of the Spark History Server using tools like Cloudera Manager or Ganglia. This can help you to identify potential memory-related issues before they become critical.\n\n    In summary, to resolve 'OutOfMemoryError' issues on the Spark History Server in Cloudera, you should try increasing the Java heap size for the Spark History Server, reducing the number of applications that are being stored in the Spark History Server, and monitoring the memory usage of the Spark History Server using tools like Cloudera Manager or Ganglia. \n\n    I hope this helps!

You can use the `hbase shell` command to check and modify HBase quotas.\n\n3. **Adjust Impala settings**: If you find that the concurrency issue is caused by Impala settings, you can try adjusting these settings to improve performance. For example, you can increase the number of Impala daemons or adjust the memory allocation for each daemon.\n\n4. **Optimize Upsert to HBase job**: Finally, you can try optimizing the 'Upsert to HBase' job itself to reduce the load on Impala and HBase.

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation.

        "chatbot_answer": " The best answer is \n    There are no specific instructions provided in the context for handling and recovering from a failed disk replacement on a DataNode (dr1node02) in HDFS. However, based on general knowledge of Hadoop and HDFS, here are some steps that could be taken:\n    1. Identify the failed disk: Determine which disk has failed and needs to be replaced.\n    2. Replace the failed disk: Physically replace the failed disk with a new one.\n    3. Reformat the new disk: Format the new disk to ensure it is properly configured for use in HDFS.\n    4. Add the new disk to the DataNode: Configure the DataNode to recognize and use the new disk.\n    5. Run the HDFS rebalancer: Run the HDFS rebalancer to ensure that data is properly distributed across the cluster.\n    It's important to note that these steps are general guidelines and may vary depending on the specific configuration and requirements of your Hadoop cluster. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consult with a qualified Hadoop administrator or engineer for guidance on handling and recovering from disk failures in your HDFS cluster.",

The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove\n   any option not present in the known-good node.

        "question": "How can you reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs?",
        "category": "Data Management & Query Execution",
        "ground_truth": "Ensure the correct number of partitions is used. In the case of the Online MergeBatch job, 468 partitions caused timeout errors. It was fixed by adjusting to 180 partitions for `prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream` and deleting unnecessary Kudu disk data.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs, you can consider the following options:\n\n1. **Increase the timeout value**: You can increase the timeout value for Kudu scans in your Spark configuration. This will give the Kudu scan more time to complete before timing out.\n\n2. **Optimize your Kudu table schema**: Make sure that your Kudu table schema is optimized for query performance. This includes choosing the right data types, using efficient primary keys, and avoiding unnecessary columns.\n\n3. **Increase the number of Kudu tablets**: If you have a high-volume Kudu table, increasing the number of tablets can help spread the load and reduce the likelihood of scan timeouts.\n\n4. **Use Kudu's parallel scan feature**: Kudu provides a parallel scan feature that allows you to split a scan into multiple smaller scans that can be executed in parallel. This can help improve scan performance and reduce the likelihood of timeouts.\n\n5. **Monitor your Kudu cluster's performance**: Keep an eye on your Kudu cluster's performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. This can help you identify potential performance bottlenecks and take corrective action before they cause scan timeouts.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs and improve the overall reliability and performance of your data processing pipeline.",

The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3.

Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/update_customer_sla_config.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log file.\n## Output Performance Data\nFor every 5-minute interval 5 HTTP requests containing CPU load, memory utilization, QoS, availability and interface utilization are sent to SQM server containing instanenous metrics for network elements and are moved to an exchange directory.

Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/populate_components_metrics_table.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/populate_components_metrics_table.sh` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Identify system or service errors in the log files e.g failed Impala query.\n### QoS and Availability\n#### Main script\nA procedure is executed periodically that triggers IPVPN-SM App to compute and transmit to the SQM server via HTTP the metrics for QoS and availability KPIs of the network elements. The procedure also inserts the KPIs into an Impala table.

Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:",

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1.

Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\t1.

So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\t1.

After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay.

        "chatbot_answer": " The process for replacing hardware on a BigStreamer node and contacting Dell support involves several steps. \n\n1. First, the user needs to ssh into the issue node with their personal account.\n2. Then, they need to find the management IP address of the IDRAC using the `ipmitool` command.\n3. Next, the user needs to connect to the IDRAC via VNC and open Firefox to access the IDRAC web interface.\n4. From the IDRAC web interface, the user needs to copy the Service Tag number of the server.\n5. Then, the user needs to call Dell support at the provided phone number and provide the Service Tag number to create a case.\n6. Finally, the user will receive instructions from Dell support on how to proceed with replacing the hardware.\n\nIt's also important to note that before taking any action on the IDRAC, the user should inform \"abc\" as per the provided context. \n\nIn addition to the steps outlined above for contacting Dell support and replacing hardware, it is also crucial to follow proper procedures for decommissioning a node from Cloudera Manager, checking for non-default IB partitions, and monitoring health-checks as described in the provided context. \n\nBy following these steps and procedures, users can ensure that they are properly replacing hardware on their BigStreamer nodes and contacting Dell support when needed, while also maintaining the overall health and performance of their system.",
        "retrieved_context": "# abc - BigStreamer - How to open a ticket to DELL\n<b>Description:</b>\n```\nBelow is a step-by-step description of the process from opening a ticket to collecting TSR logs from IDRAC.\n```\n<b>Actions Taken:</b>\n1. ssh with your personal account on the issue node.\n2. sudo -i;ipmitool lan print | grep -i 'IP Address' # To find the Managment IP. Otherwise e.g grep nodew /etc/hosts \n```\nIf the ipmitool package did not exist just install it. yum install ipmitool;\n```\n3. connect via vnc. Open firefox and type the `IP Address` from step 2\n4. From `Server-->Overview-->Server Information` copy the `Service Tag number`\n5. Call Dell support `2108129800`. They need the `Service Tag number` from step 4\n6. An engineer will create a case and sent you all the necessary steps. If not the link to collect the TSR logs is `https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/el-gr/000126803/export-a-supportassist-collection-via-idrac7-and-idrac8`\n7. Inform `abc` before any action on the IDRAC.\n# InfiniBand Replacement\nReplacing an IB card require powering off the host. Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n## Decommission\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\norder by a.id\n    ;\n\t```\n### Monitoring Health-Check\n  - Check Monitoring status.  \n\t```\t\n\t$ curl --location --request GET 'http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800/monitoring/app/check'\n\t\n\t{\"code\":0,\"info\":\"App is up and running.

For example: `-Xmx32768m -Xms32768m -server -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow`.\n\n2. **Remove Old Configuration**:\n   - Go to `cluster-> Streamsets -> Configuration`.\n   - In the `Data Collector Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for sdc-env.sh` field, remove any lines that set `SDC_JAVA_OPTS`, especially those that might conflict with the new Java heap size settings.\n\n3. **Restart Streamsets**:\n   - Go to `cluster -> Streamsets -> Restart`.\n   - Confirm the restart operation to apply the changes.\n\n4. **Check Streamsets Process Options**:\n   - Use a command like `ps -ef | grep -i streamsets | grep -i xmx` to verify that the Java process running Streamsets is using the newly configured heap size.\n\n5. **Check Max Java Heap Space for Streamsets via jconsole or jmap**:\n   - For `jconsole`, ensure you have the necessary Java options set (like `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true`) and then connect to the Streamsets process. Navigate to the \"Memory\" tab to view heap size information.\n   - For `jmap`, use a command like `jmap -heap <pid>` (replace `<pid>` with the actual process ID of the Streamsets Java process) to print information about the heap size and usage.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively increase the Java heap space for Streamsets and validate that the changes have taken effect.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n## Procedure\n### Check replication\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\n...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

Additionally after\ninstallation, completion can be enabled by executing:\n```bash\nmkdir -p /etc/bash_completion.d\nkubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl\n```\nIf possible a nice to have plugin for setting up kubeconfigs can be found at\n[kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin](https://github.com/superbrothers/kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin/releases). Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the (instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing hte following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\n# Scope\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring.

        "chatbot_answer": " ```\n\nTo diagnose and prevent duplicate job submissions in CDSW for scheduled workflows like 'Set_Point_Automation', follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check workflow logs**: Before manually triggering the workflow, check the workflow logs to ensure that there are no existing or pending jobs with the same parameters.\n\n2. **Verify job status**: Use the CDSW interface to verify the status of any recently submitted jobs. This will help you identify if a duplicate job has already been submitted.\n\n3. **Implement unique identifiers**: Consider implementing unique identifiers for each job submission. This could be based on a combination of factors such as job name, parameters, and submission time. By using unique identifiers, you can more easily detect and prevent duplicate job submissions.\n\n4. **Schedule workflows strategically**: Finally, consider scheduling your workflows at strategic times to minimize the likelihood of duplicate job submissions. For example, you might schedule your workflow to run during a maintenance window when no other jobs are likely to be submitted.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help diagnose and prevent duplicate job submissions in CDSW for scheduled workflows like 'Set_Point_Automation'.",

        "chatbot_answer": " The error 'Engine exited with status 34' on jobs in CDSW is caused by a timeout issue. This can occur when the job takes longer to complete than the allocated time. To resolve this issue, you can try increasing the timeout value or optimizing the job to reduce its execution time. Additionally, checking the job logs and CDSW engine logs can provide more detailed information about the cause of the error.\n```\n\nThe provided context does not contain information related to the error 'Engine exited with status 34' on jobs in CDSW. The context appears to be related to troubleshooting steps for export jobs, but it does not address the specific error mentioned in the question. \n\nTherefore, I must inform you that the provided context is insufficient to answer the question about the error 'Engine exited with status 34' on jobs in CDSW. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with a different topic, please feel free to ask. \n\nHowever, based on general knowledge and not the provided context, the error 'Engine exited with status 34' on jobs in CDSW could be related to a timeout issue or other configuration problems within the CDSW environment. Resolving this issue would typically involve investigating the job logs and CDSW engine logs for more detailed information about the cause of the error, and then taking appropriate actions such as adjusting timeout values, optimizing job performance, or modifying CDSW configurations as needed. \n\nAgain, please note that this response is based on general knowledge and not the provided context.

However, it provides troubleshooting steps for various export jobs (e.g., Time Deposit Export, Mass Debit Export, etc.). These steps generally involve using logs to identify failure causes and communicating with administrators to rerun jobs if necessary.\n\n    Given the context provided does not directly address the question about CDSW jobs being stuck due to resource exhaustion, a direct answer based on the information given cannot be accurately provided. The context seems to focus more on troubleshooting export jobs rather than addressing issues related to CDSW job scheduling or resource management.\n``` # Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The provided context discusses various export jobs (e.g., Time Deposit Export, Mass Debit Export) and their respective troubleshooting steps. These steps generally involve analyzing logs to identify failure causes and potentially communicating with administrators to rerun jobs if necessary.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The question posed involves CDSW (Cloudera Data Science Workbench) jobs becoming stuck in a 'Scheduled' state due to resource exhaustion. This situation implies that the jobs are not proceeding beyond the scheduling phase, likely because the required computational resources are not available.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Provided Context for Relevance**: Upon reviewing the provided context, it becomes apparent that the information given does not directly address the issue of CDSW jobs being stuck in 'Scheduled' due to resource exhaustion. The context focuses on export jobs and their troubleshooting, which does not align with the specific problem of resource exhaustion causing job scheduling issues.\n\n# Fixed solution:\nGiven the nature of the question and the provided context, a direct \"fixed solution\" cannot be accurately provided. The issue at hand involves CDSW jobs being stuck due to resource exhaustion, which is not directly addressed by the troubleshooting steps for export jobs provided in the context.\n\nHowever, in a general sense, when dealing with issues of resource exhaustion causing job scheduling problems, potential steps might include:\n\n- **Monitoring Resource Utilization**: Regularly monitoring the utilization of computational resources (e.g., CPU, memory) can help identify patterns or spikes in usage that might be contributing to resource exhaustion.\n\n- **Optimizing Job Scheduling**: Reviewing and optimizing job scheduling practices can help ensure that jobs are scheduled in a way that maximizes resource utilization without leading to exhaustion.\n\n- **Scaling Computational Resources**: If monitoring and optimization efforts reveal that the current computational resources are insufficient to meet demand, scaling these resources (e.g., adding more nodes to a cluster) can help prevent resource exhaustion.\n\n# Explanation of changes:\nGiven that the provided context does not directly address the issue of CDSW jobs being stuck in 'Scheduled' due to resource exhaustion, the \"fixed solution\" section above outlines general steps that might be taken to address issues of resource exhaustion in job scheduling. These steps include monitoring resource utilization, optimizing job scheduling practices, and scaling computational resources as needed.\n\n# Tests and example uses:\nTesting and example uses for addressing issues of CDSW jobs being stuck in 'Scheduled' due to resource exhaustion would depend on the specific environment and setup in which these jobs are being run. However, some general examples might include:\n\n- **Simulating Resource Exhaustion**: Creating a controlled test environment where resource utilization can be artificially increased to simulate conditions of resource exhaustion. This could help in testing the effectiveness of different strategies for mitigating resource exhaustion.\n\n- **Testing Job Scheduling Optimizations**: Implementing and testing various job scheduling optimizations (e.g., prioritizing jobs based on their resource requirements, implementing queueing systems to manage job submissions) to evaluate their impact on preventing or mitigating resource exhaustion.\n\nThese examples illustrate how one might approach testing and evaluating strategies for addressing issues of resource exhaustion in CDSW job scheduling. However, the specific details and approaches would depend on the particular use case and environment.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To re-run the Huawei TV flow manually for a date with missing partitions, follow these steps:\n1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to the required systems.\n2. Identify the specific date with missing partitions that you want to re-run the flow for.\n3. Check the logs for any errors or issues related to the missing partitions.\n4. If necessary, correct any underlying issues or errors that may be causing the missing partitions.\n5. Once any issues have been resolved, re-run the Huawei TV flow manually for the specific date with missing partitions.\n\nNote: The exact steps and procedures may vary depending on the specific requirements and configurations of your system. Be sure to consult relevant documentation and seek guidance from qualified personnel if needed.",

Manually get and put the files with the missing data from the Streamsets pipeline remdef directory **(Suggested Way)**\n  For each file:\n  1. From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with user `sdc` execute `sftp <sftp-user>@<sftp-server>:<sftp-path>`.\nor check via the corresponding [Grafana dashboard](https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/J4KPyBoVk/radius-dashboard?orgId=1&from=now-2d&to=now)\n  - Check the logs for the failed execution.\n- After the underlying problem has been corrected the next execution of the flow will load any files that have been delayed or failed to be loaded in a previous execution.\n- If the customer requests to load specific files after they have been processed by the flow. **In order to avoid duplicate data we have to reload the whole partition.**\n  - Ensure the files are still available on the SFTP server\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n  \n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n    sftp prdts@999.999.999.999\n    # Check for files covering the whole date affected\n    sftp> ls -l *.LOADED\n    ```\n  \n  - Suspend coordinator `Radius_Load_Coordinator`\n  - Drop partitions that were not properly loaded from following tables\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n    ``` bash\n    su - radius\n- If you are running the steps for the Primary skip this step\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n- For the previous day:\n  ``` bash\n  nohup /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/drop_hourly_partitions_STABLE.sh \"prod_trlog_online.service_audit_hourly\" \"`date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`\" >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/drop_hourly_partitions.log 2>&1 &\n  ```\n- For a specified date:\n  ``` bash\n  # e.g. 09-11-2019\n  nohup /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/drop_hourly_partitions_STABLE.sh \"prod_trlog_online.service_audit_hourly\" \"20191109\" >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/drop_hourly_partitions.log 2>&1 &\n  ```\n- Run the rest of the steps\n#### Execute aggregations\nThis flow computes aggregations for use with the [Queries](#queries).\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Script Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/update_online_aggr_tables.log`\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/update_online_aggr_tables_STABLE.sh`\n**Alerts**:\n- Edit `/user/prometheus/flows/config/settings_prod.ini` and set `days_back` to the number of days back needed to reach the partition\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Workflows`:\n    - Search for `Prometheus-Import-Workflow` and filter for `failed`\n    - Re-run it\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `File Browser`:\n    - Edit `/user/prometheus/flows/config/settings_prod.ini` and restore `days_back` to `1`\n1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n- Go to logs and check both stdout and stderr\n- In case a partition has partially been inserted into the final table `prometheus.dwh22` and the error that caused the failure has been resolved:\n  From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Impala Editor`:\n    ``` sql\n    ALTER TABLE prometheus.dwh22 DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='<par_dt>');\n    ```\n  - For the previous day:\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Workflows`:\n    - Search for `Prometheus-Import-Workflow` and filter for `failed`\n    - Re-run it\n  - For the previous day:\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Workflows`:\n    - Search for `Prometheus-Import-Workflow` and filter for `failed`\n    - Re-run it\n  - For partitions older than yesterday:\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `File Browser`:\n    - Edit `/user/prometheus/flows/config/settings_prod.ini` and set `days_back` to the number of days back needed to reach the partition\n    From `Hue` as `prometheus` in `Workflows`:\n```\nEach archived file contains a set of logs related to the specific flow run (execution ID).  \nThe filename contains info about the `<partition data>` and the `<execution ID>`  \n`csiRedis.<partition data>.<execution ID>.tar.gz`\n3. Get the log file  \n- create a new dir to store the log file\n\t```\n\tmkdir -p /tmp/csi_redis_log\n\tcd /tmp/csi_redis_log\n\t```\n- Copy from the HDFS log dir the proper log file according to the `<execution ID>` mentioned in the alert email\n`hdfs dfs -get /user/rediscsi/log/csiRedis.20230401.20230401_102030.tar.gz`\n- Extract the archived log file\n`tar xvfz ${archFile} --strip-components 9 -C .`\n- Searches for Exception messages in log files  \n`egrep -i '(Exception:|Coused by)' *.log`  \n4. In case of failure, the flow will try to load the data in the next run.  \n\tjkl-Telecom is not aware of how the data files are produced or the contents in them.  \n\tThe Spark jobs that are used by the flow, have been developed by a partner of abc (an India company).",

So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n## Troubleshooting Steps\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\nA2[Impala Tables:<br>nnmnps.report_daily_core<br>nnmnps.report_daily_cpe]\n  --> B2[Impala SELECT]\n  --> C2[FILES:<br>1. network_report_1_daily_syzefxis.YYYYMM.csv<br>2. network_report_14_daily_syzefxis.YYYYMM.csv<br>3. network_report_16_daily_syzefxis.YYYYMM.csv<br><strong>Staging Directory:</strong><br>/shared/abc/nnmnps/tmp]\n  C1-->Z[Zip file:<br>YYYYMM.zip]\n  C2-->Z\n  Z-->M[mail<br>Recipients:<br>dvordonis fa:fa-at def.gr,sla fa:fa-at def.gr,ATraianou fa:fa-at abc.gr]\n```\n**Server**: `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`  \n**Scheduler**: `Cron`  \n**Schedule**: `At the second day of each month at 6:00`  \n**Server**: `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`  \n**User**: `intra`  \n**Logs**: `/shared/abc/nnmnps/log/901_Export_CSV_reports.cron.log`  \n**Scripts**:\n- `/shared/abc/nnmnps/bin/901_Export_CSV_reports.sh`  \n- `/shared/abc/nnmnps/bin/902_Mail_Exported_Files.sh`\n**Export folder**: `/shared/abc/nnmnps/tmp`\n**Alerts**:\n- Not monitored\n### Troubleshooting\n1. `Wait` for the file to be processed\n  1. `Stop` the pipeline again\n  1. `Reset` the `File Name Pattern` to its previous value\n  1. `Start` the pipeline  \n  This will make the Streamset pipeline to process only the specific files.
