        "category": "Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution",
        "expected_answer": "To resolve the EXPORT job failure due to a duplicate key, first check for duplicate entries in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg` using Impala Shell. Then, create backup and temp tables, remove the duplicate entry by ID and timestamp, and overwrite the original table. Finally, rerun the export script:\\n```bash\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\\n```",

Start `prodrestib` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib).\n\n2. Start `prodreston` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n3. Ask for a mno Network administrator to make a call.\n   \n4. Ask them to enable the new servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to enable as explained [here](manage_wildfly.md#consolidated-network-information)).\n   \n5. Check logs for both Wildfly instances at both servers to ensure everything works.\n   \n6. When you are certain everything is OK, ask the mno Network administrators to disable the prexisting servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to disable).\n   \n7. From the access logs of the prexisting Wildfly instances check that no traffic is received. \n   \n8. Stop these Wildfly instances as described in the procedures [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib) and [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n### Migrate UC4 flows between PR/DR\n\n1. Login to the edge servers of the active and passive site using your personal account and become `root`.\n\n2. Stop UC4 agent at the edge nodes of the active site.\n   \n  ``` bash\n  systemctl stop uc4agent\n  ```\n\n3. Start service for UC4 agent at the edge servers of the passive site.\n\n  ``` bash\n  systemctl start uc4agent\n  ```\n\n4. Add entries for last successful execution of IBank DataWarehouse at the edge servers of the passive site.\n\n  ``` bash\n  sudo -u PRODUSER /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/insert_rows_dwh_monitoring.sh <date> \n  # Previous day date (YYYYMMdd), unless Sunday or Monday\n  # If Sunday or Monday enter the date of last Friday\n  ```\n\n5.

We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\\n   1. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\\n   2. From the url that we monitor the query\\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond\\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality\\n7. Upon investigation, we concluded that the change to `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` that stops the parallel execution of the query by Impala daemons (set num_nodes = 1) was the cause of the problem\\n8. We scheduled to rerun the `Upsert to HBase` stage the following day after reverting the script to use all Impala daemons for parallel execution.\\n9.  On 03/03/2023 \\n   - we disabled HBase quotas for ` PROD_IBANK` namespace on PR Site according to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/22263_mno_HBASE_TUNING.docx) MoP\\n   - we removed `set num_nodes = 1` from `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`\\n   - reran the script\\n10. The script ran successfully\\n\\n<b>Action Points:</b>\\n\\n1.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n\n## Hbase table creation\n\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 #

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account and then to `dr1node01.mno.gr`\\n2. Move to the process folder:\\n```bash\\ncd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/\\n```\\n3. Find the latest process and go to that folder. In our case is 12200-kudu-KUDU_TSERVER. So move to that folder:\\n```bash\\ncd 12200-kudu-KUDU_TSERVER\\n```\\n4. Use the keytab you just found in that folder:\\n```bash\\nkinit -kt kudu.keytab kudu/`hostname`\\n```\\n5. Check kudu cluster health and specifically for `prod_trlog_card_analytical` database in order to check if the wanted table is created.\\n```bash\\nkudu cluster ksck dr1node04.mno.gr dr1node05.mno.gr dr1node06.mno.gr | grep -i prod_trlog_card_analytical\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see the `prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp` table is not created.\\n\\n**Optional**: You can also verify that from impala-shell running the following commands:\\n- Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account\\n- impala-shell -i dr1edge01 -k --ssl\\n- `[dr1edge01.mno.gr:21000] default> use prod_trlog_card_analytical;`\\n- `[dr1edge01.mno.gr:21000] default> show tables;`\\n\\nAs you can see the `prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp` table is not created.\\n\\n6.

Login to Cloudera Manager in DR site with your personal administrative account:\\n\\n`Kudu > Instances > Click on Master > Select Tab Configuration`\\n\\n2.

Also all flows ran without errors during the issue.\\n15. Customer informed us that the `nfs` storage was full and after their actions it's ok.

Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n\n## Decommission\n\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary. From it, check for any custom, non-default IP partitions.\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# sminfo\nsminfo: sm lid 15 sm guid 0x10e0406d5aa0a0, activity count 26263191 priority 14 state 3 SMINFO_MASTER\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ibnetdiscover | grep 10e0406d5aa0a0\nswitchguid=0x10e0406d5aa0a0(10e0406d5aa0a0)\nSwitch 36 \"S-0010e0406d5aa0a0\" # \"SUN DCS 36P QDR bdax01sw-ib1 xxx.xxx.171.24\" enhanced port 0 lid 15 lmc 0\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ssh root@xxx.xxx.171.24\n\n[root@bda01sw-ib1 ~]# smpartition list active\n# Sun DCS IB partition config file\n# This file is generated, do not edit\n#! version_number : 0\nDefault=0x7fff, ipoib : ALL_CAS=full, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full;\nSUN_DCS=0x0001, ipoib : ALL_SWITCHES=full;\n\nIf there are IB partitions other than default partitions, then refer to MOS ndef 1985159.1 for additional steps that will need to be taken before the old HCA is removed.\n```\n- [MOS ndef 1985159.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=SrDetailText&sourceId=3-37179888534&id=1985159.1)\n\nIf `smpartition list active` shows output similar to the above, no actions are needed. If not the attached procedure must followed in order to replace the UUIDs.\n\n## Fix Interface\n\nOracle runs an automated configuration scripts that sets arp checking of the gateway in certain interfaces. If\nthe interfaces are non-routable, as is the case for bondeth1 and bondeth2, these options must be removed.\n\n1. Check for any interfaces that should not be in the DOWN state with `ip a`\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove\n   any option not present in the known-good node. Generally these would be options referring to ARP.\n4. Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n\n## Recommission\n\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n\nAfter everything is back online the kudu tablet on the host might not have taken on any tablets. This\nis normal as all tablets have been replicated to the other hosts. With time it will take on tablets as\nwell.\n\nThis can be verified using `ksck` as the kudu user.\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\n\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n\n### Backup Procedure\n\n- From node1 as root:\n\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n\n```\n\n- From edge nodes as root:\n\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n\n### Check unsigned certificates\n\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\n\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n\n### Check signed certificates from mno\n\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\n\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\n\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n\n- Check the issuer\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n\n- Check the subject\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n\n- Check the TLS Web\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n\n- Check the dates\n\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n\n - Or with a for loop for all the files\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n\n\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\n\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder : `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\n\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n\n\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- \n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\n with the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nwith the certificate from \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 `cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \n\nand copy the section\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\n\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n\n#### Check new certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n\n#### Haproxy certificates\n\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n\n**Special caution**:\n\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\n\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\n\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n\n```\n\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\n",

Going to Cloudera Manager => Yarn => Applications =>\\n\\n``\\nname RLIKE '.*PROD_IBank_MergeBatch' and application_duration > 3h\\n``\\n\\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/Yarn_Applications_Merge_Batch_Prod_Ibank.png)\\n\\nWe notice that the Merge batch for `20230531` was running `14 hours` without finishing.\\n\\n2. As a second step, let's check the number of records in `impala` and the space occupied in `hdfs` by each `par_dt` from `20230509` to `20230530`\\n\\nBelow we see the space at the `hdfs` level:\\n\\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/HDFS_du.png)\\n\\nThe number of records in `impala` as an example for the `par_dt` `20230511` and `20230512`:\\n\\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/impala_query_par_dt_count.PNG)\\n\\nWhat we observe above is that while the `par_dt` `20230511` and `20230512` they have no difference in the number of records, they are twice as large. Where did this come from and what impact does it have? We will analyze it in the next steps.\\n\\n3. Let's see how this increase came about:\\n\\nAnalyzing the sum of length for response_text_data for each service, we notice that from `12/05/2023` onwards the service_name `'/CAMPAIGNMANAGEMENT/GETCAMPAIGNS'` takes up much more space as shown below compared to previous days.\\n\\nAfter `20230512`\\n\\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/After_20230512.png)\\n\\nBefore `20230512`\\n\\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/.media/IM2158906/Before_20230512.png)\\n\\nUntil 11/05/2023 the average avg(length(response_text_data)) of prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit is stable at ~12K while from 12/05/2023 we see it approximately doubling.\\n\\nThis resulted in the `Merge Batch` not finishing as since the size of each `json` has doubled it takes much longer to execute the spark job.\\n\\n4. How did we handle it to get it running?\\n\\nAs described [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch) in the subchapter `If the problem is with resources (out-of-memory errors):` we ran the `Merge Batch` in separate chunks of the day.\\n\\nThe process took 3 days to complete as each chunk of the day took ~9 hours.\\n\\n5. After it was completed on one site, `distcp` was performed as described in [issue](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/issues/20201218-IM1389913.md) for the `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit` and `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old` tables with `par_dt` `20230530` on the other site.

Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n\n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n\n## Pollaploi Flow\n\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**",

That is, they contain all the historicity of the reference data.  \nThe data of each load is stored in a separate partition identified by the date of the loading (i.e. par_dt=20230530)  \n\n##### Steps 6-7:\nScript `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` reads the most recently added data from the LOAD table and store them as a snapshot into a separate table (aka snapshot tables).  \nThe data of these tables are used for the enrichment of various fact data (i.e. Traffica (SAI))\n\n\n## Manually Run\n`210_refData_Load.sh` script is responsible for the loading of a reference file.\n\nTo run the script two arguments are required  \n`/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh <refType>  <refDate>`  \n\n1st: **\\<refType\\>**, the Reference Type\n```\n- CELLS\n- CRM\n- DEVICES\n- SERVICES\n```\n\n2nd: **\\<refDate\\>**, the date that the flat file contains in its filename  \n\ti.e.\n```\ncells_20220207.csv.gz\ncells_20220208.csv.gz\ncells_20220209.csv.gz\n\nservices_20220207.csv.gz\ndevices_20220208.csv.gz\n\ncrm_20220209.csv.gz\n```\n\nIn case of loading the files above we should execute the following commands\n```\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh CELLS 20220207\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh cells 20220208\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh CELLS 20220209\n\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh services 20220207\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh DEVICES 20220208\n\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh crm 20220209\n```\n\nOnce the loads completed, the flat files renamed to <CURRENT_YYYYMMDD>.LOADED\n```\ncells_20220207.csv.20230531.LOADED\ncells_20220208.csv.20230531.LOADED\ncells_20220209.csv.20230531.LOADED\n\nservices_20220207.csv.20230531.LOADED\ndevices_20220208.csv.20230531.LOADED\n\ncrm_20220209.csv.20230531.LOADED\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n**Currently, the Reference Data flow does not support the `Monitoring` services.**  \n\n- An email will be sent by the system with the point of failure.\ni.e.\n```\nSubject: ALERT: Reference data Loading, Type:CELL,  File:cells_20220207.csv\nBody: \n\tReference Type  : CELL\n\tReference File  : cells_20220207.csv\n\tReference Scirpt: 210_refData_Load.sh\n\t------------------------------------------\n\tERROR:$(date '+%F %T'), ALTER TABLE or LOAD DATA command failed.\n```\n\n- Check the log files for errors/exceptions  \n\n```\negrep -i 'error|fail|exception|problem' /shared/abc/refdata/log/210_refData_Load.YYYYMM.log\negrep -i 'error|fail|exception|problem' /shared/abc/refdata/log/220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.YYYYMM.log\n```\n\nIn case of failure follow the instructions described in **`Manually Run`**\n\n### Common errors  \n- Reference data file is empty or the contents of the file is not the expected.  \nIf this is the case, update abc that the file is invalid and ask them to send a new.  \n\n- Other factors not related to the specific flow\n\t- impala/hive availability\n\t- Kerberos authentication\n\t*Ndef: The flow checks if the ticket is still active before any HDFS action.  \n\tIn case of expiration the flow performs a `kinit` command*\n\n## Data Check\n- **Check final tables for new partitions**:\n\t```\n\tsu - intra\n\t\n\t/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k -q \"refresh refdata.rd_cells_load; show partitions refdata.rd_cells_load;\"\n\t\n\t+----------+-----------+--------+---------+\n\t| par_dt   | #Rows     | #Files | Size    |\n\t+----------+-----------+--------+---------+\n\t| 20220227 | 98090     | 1      | 41.88MB |\n\t| 20220228 | 98021     | 1      | 41.84MB |\n\t| 20220301 | 97353     | 1      | 41.76MB |\n\t| Total    | 142404322 | 1500   | 59.63GB |\n\t+----------+-----------+--------+---------+\n\t```\n\n- **Check the amount of data in final tables**:\n\t```\n\tsu - intra\n\t\n\t/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k -q \"select par_dt, count(*) as cnt from refdata.rd_cells_load group by par_dt order by 1;\"\n\t\n\tpar_dt   | cnt    \n\t---------+--------\n\t20221130 | 2784494\n\t```\n# Energy-Efficiency Pollaploi\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is an `Oozie Flow` responsible to **load data** from **txt files** into **impala tables**. Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n\n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n\n## Pollaploi Flow\n\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**",

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\\n\\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\\n# Application Flow\\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\\n\\n### IPVPN-SLA\\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\\n\\n### IPVPN-SM\\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\\n## IPVPN-SM Application\\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\\n\\n### Ingestion Endpoint\\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\\n\\n### Check application status\\n\\n```\\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\\n```\\n\\n## Application Flow Diagram\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart TD;\\n  A(\\\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\\\") --> B(\\\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\\\")\\n  B -- 1.

Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\\n\\n### Auto-retry mechanism\\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\\n\\n\\n# Support\\n\\n## Check request status via Monitoring\\n### Grafana\\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\\n\\n### Monitoring DB\\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request.

The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \\n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\\n\\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\\n### SMSystemException\\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\\n\\n### SMValidationException\\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\\n\\n### AppQueryIngestionException\\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\\n\\n### SMAuthException\\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\\n**Support Actions:**\\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\\n\\n\\n## Actions\\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\\n1. Create keystore\\n```\\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\\n```\\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\\n1. Update keystore\\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\\n\\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\\n\\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\\n\\n1. In case we want perform the execution for just **one 5m interval**, we provide the same argument for `reference-start-time` and `reference-end-time` fields. E.g. for 5m period of 18/12/2022 10:10:\\n```\\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181010\\n```\\n2. If we want to perform requests for **5 multiple consecutive** 5min intervals E.g. for 5m periods of 18/12/2022 10:10 to 10:30 (inclusive):\\n\\n```\\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181030\\n```\\nThe logs of this operation are appended to the log files in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`.\\n",

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.",

If a partition has partially been inserted into the final table `prometheus.dwh22`, drop the partition using `ALTER TABLE prometheus.dwh22 DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='<par_dt>');`.\n4.  Re-run the failed workflow for the previous day or older partitions by editing the `settings_prod.ini` file and setting `days_back` to the required number of days.\n5.  After re-running the workflow, restore the `days_back` setting in the `settings_prod.ini` file to its original value.\n\nBy following these steps, you can resolve a failed Prometheus import flow if a partition was partially inserted.

        "context": "# TeMIP\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\\n\\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\\n\\n## Flows\\n\\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\\n1. Main Application flow\\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\\n1. Alert Mail flow\\n\\n### Main Application\\n\\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\\n\\n``` mermaid\\n  flowchart TD\\n  A[TeMIP Server] \\n  B[Wildfly Server]\\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\\n  style A fill: #45b39d\\n```\\n\\n- **TeMIP Server**\\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\\n  - **Port:** `7180`\\n- **Wildfly Server**\\n  - **Servers:**\\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\\n  - **User:** `temip`\\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\\n\\n**Alerts:**\\n\\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\\n  - **Subject:** `\\\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\\\"`\\n  - **Body:** `\\\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\\\"`\\n\\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\\n\\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \\nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \\n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\\n\\n### Initialization/Synchronization\\n\\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\\n\\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\\n\\n``` mermaid\\n  flowchart TD\\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\\n  style C fill: #45b39d\\n```\\n\\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\\n  - **User:** `temip`\\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\\n\\n**Alerts:**\\n\\n- **Not Monitored**\\n\\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\\n\\n1. Check logs for any errors\\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \\nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\\n\\n### Move Kudu to Impala\\n\\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\\n\\n``` mermaid\\n flowchart TD\\n  A[OOZIE Job] \\n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\\n  A --> Z\\n  A --> K\\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\\n```\\n\\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\\n  - **User:** `temip`\\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\\n\\n**Alerts:**\\n\\n- **Not Monitored**\\n\\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\\n\\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\\n\\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\\n\\n### Alert Mail\\n\\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\\n\\n``` mermaid\\n flowchart TD\\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\\n```\\n\\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\\n  - **User:** `temip`\\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\\n\\n**Alerts:**\\n\\n- **Not Monitored**\\n\\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\\n\\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\\n\\n## Manual Actions\\n\\n### Restart Wildfly Server\\n---\\n\\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\\n\\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \\n\\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\\n    1. Workflows:\\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \\n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\\n\\n1. `Sanity Checks`\\n\\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \\n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \\n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\\n\\n        ``` sql\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\\n        ```\\n\\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\\n---\\n\\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\\n\\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\\n\\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\\n\\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\\n\\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \\n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \\n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\\n\\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \\n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \\nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\\n\\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \\n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \\nwhere v is the wrong partition.\\n\\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\\n\\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\\n    ``` bash\\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \\\"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\\\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \\\"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\\\"\\n    ```\\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle.

        "chatbot_response": " The steps involved in exporting TeMIP alarms from Kudu to Impala are as follows:\n1. Run the Oozie coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`.\n2. This coordinator executes a workflow that moves alarms from Kudu to Impala.\n3. The workflow uses a script to perform the data transfer.\n4. The script reads data from the Kudu tables and writes it to the corresponding Impala tables.\n\nThese steps are automated through the Oozie coordinator and workflow, ensuring that the data is transferred regularly and efficiently.",
        "retrieved_context": "# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\n\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n\n### Ingestion Endpoint\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n\n### Check application status\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n\n## Application Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

The files used are:\n    - `/etc/krb5.conf`\n    - `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/jaas.conf`\n    - `/home/users/ipvpn/ipvpn.keytab`\n\n- IPVPN-SM app:\n  The application uses HAProxy, a load balancer that distributes incoming requests to the deployed application nodes.\n  - **HAProxy**:\n  Host: `un-vip` ,\n  Port: `13001`\n  - **Application**:\n    Hosts: `un1/un2`,\n    Active Ports:\n      - HTTP port : `13000`\n      - JMX port : `13800`\n\n\n- External SQM server:\n\t- **host**: `gw-prod-sqm.aksprd.abc.gr`\n\t- **port**: `443`\n\t- **endpoint**: `/inventory/measurements`\n\n\n## Bash scripts\nIn addition to the IPVPN-SM application, IPVPN-SM utilizes certain bash scripts. Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`\n\nThe specific order in which they are called is the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[\"export_*_kpis.sh<br><i>IPVPN-SLA</i>\"] -->B[compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh]\nB -->C[query_sm.sh]\nC --/ingest-query-->D(SM Application)\nstyle A fill:darkgray\nstyle B fill:#ECECEC\nstyle C fill:#ECECEC\n```\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nStop/Start guide on [abc_BigStreamer_Apps_MoP_Restart.docx](https://ghi.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/abcBigData/EZsK97GxFyVHkeBoFTFjuRYBtPF7lK86cTA44wMhayNlNA?e=Gjh0ZO)  \nCheck project wiki [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#deployment-instructions)\n\n\n## SQM Token Authentication\nThe authentication on the SQM server is done with the HTTP Token Auth in IPVPN-SM application. It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n\n# Failure Handling\n## Logs\n\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\n\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n\n\n# Support\n\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### AppQueryIngestionException\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMAuthException\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\n\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\n\n1. In case we want perform the execution for just **one 5m interval**, we provide the same argument for `reference-start-time` and `reference-end-time` fields. E.g. for 5m period of 18/12/2022 10:10:\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181010\n```\n2. If we want to perform requests for **5 multiple consecutive** 5min intervals E.g. for 5m periods of 18/12/2022 10:10 to 10:30 (inclusive):\n\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181030\n```\nThe logs of this operation are appended to the log files in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`.\n# Manage Connectivity with Viavi Kafka\n\n- [Manage Connectivity with Viavi Kafka](#manage-connectivity-with-viavi-kafka)\n  - [Setup](#setup)\n    - [HAProxy Configuration](#haproxy-configuration)\n  - [Procedure](#procedure)\n    - [Manage HAProxy](#manage-haproxy)\n    - [Manage DNS entries](#manage-dns-entries)\n\n## Setup\n\nIncelligent wants to develop an application with Viavi's Kafka cluster as the datasource.This project aims to replace the current feed that powers RAN.AI Geolocation that is based on SFTP file transfers with a Spark Streaming application.

Start `prodrestib` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib).\n\n2. Start `prodreston` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n3. Ask for a mno Network administrator to make a call.\n   \n4. Ask them to enable the new servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to enable as explained [here](manage_wildfly.md#consolidated-network-information)).\n   \n5. Check logs for both Wildfly instances at both servers to ensure everything works.\n   \n6. When you are certain everything is OK, ask the mno Network administrators to disable the prexisting servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to disable).\n   \n7. From the access logs of the prexisting Wildfly instances check that no traffic is received. \n   \n8. Stop these Wildfly instances as described in the procedures [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib) and [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n### Migrate UC4 flows between PR/DR\n\n1. Login to the edge servers of the active and passive site using your personal account and become `root`.\n\n2. Stop UC4 agent at the edge nodes of the active site.\n   \n  ``` bash\n  systemctl stop uc4agent\n  ```\n\n3. Start service for UC4 agent at the edge servers of the passive site.\n\n  ``` bash\n  systemctl start uc4agent\n  ```\n\n4. Add entries for last successful execution of IBank DataWarehouse at the edge servers of the passive site.\n\n  ``` bash\n  sudo -u PRODUSER /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/insert_rows_dwh_monitoring.sh <date> \n  # Previous day date (YYYYMMdd), unless Sunday or Monday\n  # If Sunday or Monday enter the date of last Friday\n  ```\n\n5. Migrate the creation of trigger files for external jobs\n\n  - On the active site:\n\n    ``` bash\n    vi /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_STABLE_v2.sh\n    # Comment the followin lines along with the assosiated checks\n    # touch /home/bank_central_mno_gr/datawarehouse_status/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n    # touch /opt/applications/landing_zone/PRODUSER/triggers/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n    ```  \n  - On the passive site:\n\n    ``` bash\n    vi /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_STABLE_v2.sh\n    # Uncomment the followin lines along with the assosiated checks\n    # touch /home/bank_central_mno_gr/datawarehouse_status/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n    # touch /opt/applications/landing_zone/PRODUSER/triggers/IBANK_SA_`date '+%Y%m%d'`.READY\n    ```",

        "chatbot_response": " To increase Java heap space for Streamsets, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Configure Java Options from Cloudera Manager**: You can set the Java options by navigating to `cluster -> Streamsets -> Configuration -> Java options`. Set the `-Xmx` and `-Xms` values as needed (e.g., `-Xmx32768m -Xms32768m`). Also, ensure that other necessary Java options are included.\n\n2.  **Remove Old Configuration**: Remove any old configuration related to Java heap space settings by navigating to `cluster-> Streamsets -> Configuration -> Data Collector Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for sdc-env.sh`. Look for and remove the line starting with `export SDC_JAVA_OPTS`.\n\n3.  **Restart Streamsets**: After making changes, restart Streamsets by navigating to `cluster -> Streamsets -> Restart`.\n\n4.  **Check Streamsets Process Options**: Verify that the Java heap space settings have been applied correctly by checking the process options for Streamsets using a command like `ps -ef | grep -i streamsets | grep -i xmx`. Look for the `-Xmx` and `-Xms` values in the output.\n\n5.  **Check Max Java Heap Space for Streamsets via jconsole or jmap**: Finally, use tools like `jconsole` or `jmap` to verify that the maximum Java heap space has been set correctly for Streamsets. For example, you can run `jmap -heap <pid>` (replace `<pid>` with the actual process ID of Streamsets) and look at the output to confirm the heap size settings.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to increase the Java heap space for Streamsets and validate that the changes have been applied correctly.     To increase Java heap space for Streamsets, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Configure Java options from Cloudera Manager by setting `-Xmx` and `-Xms` values as needed.\n2.

This guide is for MySQL.\n\n### Glossary\n\n- MYSQL replication: It is a process that enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to copied automatically to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)\n\n## Setup\n\n### Mysql Instances\n\n#### PR\n\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n\n**User**: `mysql`\n\n**Port**: `3306`\n\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n\n#### DR\n\n**User**: `mysql`\n\n**Port**: `3306`\n\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n**Master Mysql Host**: `dr1node03.mno.gr`\n\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `dr1node02.mno.gr`\n\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Identify the problem\n\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n      ```\n\n2. If one of `Slave_IO_Running` or `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`, then the replication is broken\n\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n      tar -ztvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz | grep -i mysql_backup # List contents of the tar.gz file.Under backup folder stored tar.gz files from daily backup procedure,for both sites, with the format CLUSTER_year-month-day.tar.gz (e.g DRBDA_2022-03-21.tar.gz). This files contains several gz files combined in a tar.gz. Now we need to find the exact name of the gz backup file for mysql backup to proceed at next step.\n      tar -zxvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz # Untar from the tar.gz file the exact gz backup file for mysql backup that found from previous step. The exaxt name would be placed on mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz possition\n      gunzip mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz # Decompress the file that untared from previous step\n      mysql -uroot -p < mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql\n      ```\n\n3. After succesfully restoration on **Slave Mysql Host** start slave:\n\n      ``` bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n      - No error should exist on `Last_Error`\n      - If no error appeared then `START SLAVE`\n\n      ```bash\n      START SLAVE;\n      ```\n\t  \n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n\t- Both Slave_IO_Running and Slave_SQL_Running are set to `Yes` now. And the replication is running without any error.\n\t- `Seconds_Behind_Master` should be 0 after some minutes\n# Manage IDM Replication\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Setup\n\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes: REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes:\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    Seems that preauthentication is enforced via `krbTicketFlags`. We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\n# How to create a keytab in NYMA\n\nLogin into kerb1 node as root\n\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\n\nUse command-line interface to the Kerberos administration system\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local\n```\n\nCheck if there is a principal for the corresponding username\n\n```bash\nlistprincs <username>@CNE.abc.GR\n```\n\nCreate a principal if there is not one\n\n```bash\naddprinc <username>CNE.abc.GR\n```\n\nCreate the keytab\n\n```bash\nktadd -k /tmp/<username>.keytab -norandkey <username>@CNE.abc.GR\n```\n\nCopy the keytab file to un2 node\n\n```bash\nscp -p /tmp/<username>.keytab un2:/tmp\n```\n\nLogin into un2, place keytab file under /home/users/skokkoris/ and change ownership into skokkoris\n\n```bash\nssh un2\nsudo -i\ncp -p /tmp/<username>.keytab /home/users/skokkoris/\nchown skokkoris. /home/users/skokkoris/<username>.keytab\n```",

However, I can suggest some general steps that might help address the issue:\n1. Review the workflow configuration: Check the settings for the 'Set_Point_Automation' workflow to ensure that it is not configured to submit duplicate jobs.\n2. Implement job deduplication: Consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent duplicate job submissions. This could involve storing job metadata in a database or using a message queue to handle job submissions.\n3. Monitor workflow execution: Keep a close eye on the execution of the 'Set_Point_Automation' workflow, and investigate any instances of duplicate job submissions.\n\nI hope these general suggestions are helpful in addressing the issue.

        "chatbot_response": " The CDSW job 'pollaploi' from the Energy Bills project fails frequently due to its dependency on an external SFTP server for file retrieval. To improve the reliability of this job, it is recommended to configure the job to handle potential connection timeouts or failures when attempting to connect to the SFTP server. Additionally, implementing a retry mechanism with a reasonable number of attempts and a suitable delay between retries can help mitigate the impact of transient connectivity issues. By incorporating these strategies into the configuration of the 'pollaploi' CDSW job, its resilience to failures caused by external dependencies can be significantly improved.\n``` #+END_HTML\nThe provided context does not contain information about a CDSW job named 'pollaploi'.

        "retrieved_context": "# Energy-Efficiency Pollaploi\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is an `Oozie Flow` responsible to **load data** from **txt files** into **impala tables**. Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n\n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n\n## Pollaploi Flow\n\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**",

        "chatbot_response": " You are an AI assistant. Use the provided context to answer the question.\n\n    Answer:\n    To recover a Cloudera host like `mn3` that lost contact with Cloudera Manager due to CPU errors, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify and resolve the underlying issue**: In this case, it's CPU errors. You may need to check system logs, run diagnostics, or consult with hardware support teams to resolve the issue.\n\n2. **Restart the host**: Once the underlying issue is resolved, restart the `mn3` host to ensure all services are properly initialized.\n\n3. **Recommission the host in Cloudera Manager**: After the host is back online, you will need to recommission it through Cloudera Manager. This involves going into maintenance mode, decommissioning the roles, and then recommissioning the host without starting any roles initially.\n\n4. **Start roles on the recommissioned host**: Finally, after ensuring the host is properly integrated back into the cluster, you can start the roles that were previously running on `mn3`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to recover a Cloudera host like `mn3` and reintegrate it into your cluster.",

Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n\n## Decommission\n\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary. From it, check for any custom, non-default IP partitions.\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# sminfo\nsminfo: sm lid 15 sm guid 0x10e0406d5aa0a0, activity count 26263191 priority 14 state 3 SMINFO_MASTER\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ibnetdiscover | grep 10e0406d5aa0a0\nswitchguid=0x10e0406d5aa0a0(10e0406d5aa0a0)\nSwitch 36 \"S-0010e0406d5aa0a0\" # \"SUN DCS 36P QDR bdax01sw-ib1 xxx.xxx.171.24\" enhanced port 0 lid 15 lmc 0\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ssh root@xxx.xxx.171.24\n\n[root@bda01sw-ib1 ~]# smpartition list active\n# Sun DCS IB partition config file\n# This file is generated, do not edit\n#! version_number : 0\nDefault=0x7fff, ipoib : ALL_CAS=full, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full;\nSUN_DCS=0x0001, ipoib : ALL_SWITCHES=full;\n\nIf there are IB partitions other than default partitions, then refer to MOS ndef 1985159.1 for additional steps that will need to be taken before the old HCA is removed.\n```\n- [MOS ndef 1985159.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=SrDetailText&sourceId=3-37179888534&id=1985159.1)\n\nIf `smpartition list active` shows output similar to the above, no actions are needed. If not the attached procedure must followed in order to replace the UUIDs.\n\n## Fix Interface\n\nOracle runs an automated configuration scripts that sets arp checking of the gateway in certain interfaces. If\nthe interfaces are non-routable, as is the case for bondeth1 and bondeth2, these options must be removed.\n\n1. Check for any interfaces that should not be in the DOWN state with `ip a`\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove\n   any option not present in the known-good node. Generally these would be options referring to ARP.\n4. Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n\n## Recommission\n\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n\nAfter everything is back online the kudu tablet on the host might not have taken on any tablets. This\nis normal as all tablets have been replicated to the other hosts. With time it will take on tablets as\nwell.\n\nThis can be verified using `ksck` as the kudu user.\n# Below procedure describes how to decrypt an encrypted disk\n\n\n###### Back up \nBackup data of encrypted disk\n\n>Ndef_1: In our case we don't have data in this partition. So, we don't have to backup\n\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n\n###### Decrypt encrypted disk\n\n1. Make sure that Kafka and Kudu services are down\n\n>Ndef_2: You should stop kafka and kudu in case we have data at `/data/1` partition. In our case we don't have data so we skip this step\n\n- From Cloudera Manager > Kafka > Stop\n\n- From Cloudera Manager > Kudu > Stop\n\n2. Check that KTS is up and running\n\nFrom Cloudera Manager with admin account:\n\n- Go to Keytrustee > Key Trustee Server  \n\n3. Remove /data/1 mountpoint that is no longer in use\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n4. Check ztab:\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\nThe output should be commented \n\n5. List the mountpoints\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n\n6. Uncomment the decrypted mount points on fstab\n\nUncomment line for `/dev/mapper/ol_pr1edge01-data_1 /data/1 xfs defauts 0 0` at `/etc/fstab`\n\n7. Check if disk is mounted with below command\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n\n8. Move data from backup directory back to decrypted disk\n\n>Ndef_3: Occurs only if step 1 is performed\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n```\n\n\n9. Start kudu and kafka\n\n>Ndef_4: Occurs only if step 1 is performed \n\n- From Cloudera Manager > Kafka > Start\n\n- From Cloudera Manager > Kudu > Start\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\n\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n\n### Backup Procedure\n\n- From node1 as root:\n\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n\n```\n\n- From edge nodes as root:\n\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n\n### Check unsigned certificates\n\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\n\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n\n### Check signed certificates from mno\n\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\n\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\n\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n\n- Check the issuer\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n\n- Check the subject\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n\n- Check the TLS Web\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n\n- Check the dates\n\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n\n - Or with a for loop for all the files\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n\n\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\n\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder : `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\n\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n\n\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- \n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\n with the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nwith the certificate from \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 `cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \n\nand copy the section\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\n\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```",

CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\n\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n\n### Ingestion Endpoint\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n\n### Check application status\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n\n## Application Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

The files used are:\n    - `/etc/krb5.conf`\n    - `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/jaas.conf`\n    - `/home/users/ipvpn/ipvpn.keytab`\n\n- IPVPN-SM app:\n  The application uses HAProxy, a load balancer that distributes incoming requests to the deployed application nodes.\n  - **HAProxy**:\n  Host: `un-vip` ,\n  Port: `13001`\n  - **Application**:\n    Hosts: `un1/un2`,\n    Active Ports:\n      - HTTP port : `13000`\n      - JMX port : `13800`\n\n\n- External SQM server:\n\t- **host**: `gw-prod-sqm.aksprd.abc.gr`\n\t- **port**: `443`\n\t- **endpoint**: `/inventory/measurements`\n\n\n## Bash scripts\nIn addition to the IPVPN-SM application, IPVPN-SM utilizes certain bash scripts. Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`\n\nThe specific order in which they are called is the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[\"export_*_kpis.sh<br><i>IPVPN-SLA</i>\"] -->B[compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh]\nB -->C[query_sm.sh]\nC --/ingest-query-->D(SM Application)\nstyle A fill:darkgray\nstyle B fill:#ECECEC\nstyle C fill:#ECECEC\n```\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nStop/Start guide on [abc_BigStreamer_Apps_MoP_Restart.docx](https://ghi.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/abcBigData/EZsK97GxFyVHkeBoFTFjuRYBtPF7lK86cTA44wMhayNlNA?e=Gjh0ZO)  \nCheck project wiki [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#deployment-instructions)\n\n\n## SQM Token Authentication\nThe authentication on the SQM server is done with the HTTP Token Auth in IPVPN-SM application. It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n\n# Failure Handling\n## Logs\n\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\n\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n\n\n# Support\n\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### AppQueryIngestionException\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMAuthException\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm",

Start `prodrestib` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib).\n\n2. Start `prodreston` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n3. Ask for a mno Network administrator to make a call.\n   \n4. Ask them to enable the new servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to enable as explained [here](manage_wildfly.md#consolidated-network-information)).\n   \n5. Check logs for both Wildfly instances at both servers to ensure everything works.\n   \n6. When you are certain everything is OK, ask the mno Network administrators to disable the prexisting servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to disable).\n   \n7. From the access logs of the prexisting Wildfly instances check that no traffic is received. \n   \n8. Stop these Wildfly instances as described in the procedures [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib) and [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n### Migrate UC4 flows between PR/DR\n\n1. Login to the edge servers of the active and passive site using your personal account and become `root`.\n\n2. Stop UC4 agent at the edge nodes of the active site.\n   \n  ``` bash\n  systemctl stop uc4agent\n  ```\n\n3. Start service for UC4 agent at the edge servers of the passive site.\n\n  ``` bash\n  systemctl start uc4agent\n  ```\n\n4. Add entries for last successful execution of IBank DataWarehouse at the edge servers of the passive site.\n\n  ``` bash\n  sudo -u PRODUSER /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/insert_rows_dwh_monitoring.sh <date> \n  # Previous day date (YYYYMMdd), unless Sunday or Monday\n  # If Sunday or Monday enter the date of last Friday\n  ```\n\n5.

        "chatbot_response": " To completely disable root SSH access on all nodes while ensuring scripts work with a substitute user, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Substitute User**: Create a new user on each node that will be used as a substitute for the root user. This user should have the necessary permissions to run the scripts.\n\n2. **Configure SSH Keys**: Configure SSH keys for the substitute user on each node. This will allow the scripts to connect to the nodes without requiring a password.\n\n3. **Modify Scripts**: Modify the scripts to use the substitute user instead of the root user. Update the scripts to use the SSH keys configured in step 2.\n\n4. **Disable Root SSH Access**: Once the scripts have been modified to use the substitute user, disable root SSH access on all nodes. This can be done by setting the `PermitRootLogin` option to `no` in the SSH configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).\n\nBy following these steps, you can completely disable root SSH access on all nodes while ensuring that scripts continue to work with a substitute user.\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_urls(text):\n    pattern = r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\\\(\\\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+)'\n    urls = re.findall(pattern, text)\n    return urls\n\ntext = \"\"\"\nYou are an AI assistant.

All procedures pertain to PR and DR edge nodes, except the RPM repository\ncreation which is performed on pr1node1:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n\n## Repository Creation\n\nThis step only needs to be performed once as all subsequent RPM's will be placed inside this\nrepository. SSH into **p1node01** and as root create the repository directories:\n\n    $ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n    $ sudo -i\n    # mkdir -p /var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages\n\nDownload the desired RPMs from [Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html), place them inside\n`/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` and create the repository:\n\n    # cd /var/www/html/oracle_java\n    # createrepo .\n\nSSH into one of the edge nodes, create the corresponding yum repo file and **scp** it into\nall other edge nodes:\n\n    $ ssh Exxx@pr1edge01\n    $ sudo -i\n\n    # vi /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo\n    [oracle_java]\n    name = oracle_java\n    baseurl =  http://p1node01.mno.gr/oracle_java\n    enabled = 1\n    gpgcheck = 0\n\n    # scp /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle_java.repo XXXedgeXX:/etc/yum.repos.d/\n\nFinally on each edge node install the above packages:\n\n    # yum clean all\n    # yum install jdk-1.8\n\n## Repository Update\n\nDownload the desired version of Oracle Java 8 from\n[Oracle Java SE Archive Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) or\n[Oracle Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and\nplace the RPMs inside `/var/www/html/oracle_java/Packages` of **pr1node01**.

        "chatbot_response": " The proper procedure for updating the BIOS and iDRAC firmware on a Dell PowerEdge C6320 server via CLI involves several steps. \n\n    First, ensure you have the latest version of the iDRAC tools installed on your system. You can download these tools from the Dell support website.\n\n    Next, connect to the iDRAC interface using a tool like `ssh` or `ipmitool`. The default IP address for the iDRAC interface is usually printed on a label on the back or front of the server.\n\n    Once connected to the iDRAC interface, you can use the `racadm` command-line utility to update the BIOS and iDRAC firmware. \n\n    To update the BIOS, use the following command:\n    ```\n    racadm -r <iDRAC_IP> -u <username> -p <password> update -f /path/to/bios_update.exe\n    ```\n\n    To update the iDRAC firmware, use the following command:\n    ```\n    racadm -r <iDRAC_IP> -u <username> -p <password> update -f /path/to/idrac_firmware_update.dffu\n    ```\n\n    Replace `<iDRAC_IP>` with the IP address of your iDRAC interface, and replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual iDRAC username and password. \n\n    Also, make sure to replace `/path/to/bios_update.exe` and `/path/to/idrac_firmware_update.dffu` with the actual paths to the BIOS update executable and the iDRAC firmware update file on your system.\n\n    After updating the BIOS and iDRAC firmware, it is recommended to restart the server to ensure that the updates take effect. \n\n    You can use the `racadm` utility to restart the server remotely. To do this, use the following command:\n    ```\n    racadm -r <iDRAC_IP> -u <username> -p <password> serveraction powercycle\n    ```\n\n    This will restart the server and ensure that the BIOS and iDRAC firmware updates take effect.\n\n    It is also recommended to verify that the updates were successful by checking the BIOS version and iDRAC firmware version after the update. \n\n    You can use the `racadm` utility to check the BIOS version and iDRAC firmware version remotely. To do this, use the following commands:\n    ```\n    racadm -r <iDRAC_IP> -u <username> -p <password> getsysinfo\n    racadm -r <iDRAC_IP> -u <username> -p <password> getfwversion\n    ```\n\n    These commands will display the BIOS version and iDRAC firmware version, respectively. \n\n    By following these steps, you can update the BIOS and iDRAC firmware on your Dell PowerEdge C6320 server via CLI.",

In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\n1bd22e95ef01        5a84bb672db8           \"kube-scheduler --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-scheduler_kube-scheduler-cti-cx1_kube-system_649aa160f1bd0840b2bb0f70b6493f99_9\ncf43799ae77d0       b6e18ffb844e6          \"kube-apiserver --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                 \n```\n\nStop containers IDs:\n\n```bash\nctrctl stop 1350c48cbfb5 1bd22e95ef01 cf3cb7655b99d\n```\n\n> Ndef_1: Keep in mind that when the containers will be stopped, there will be downtime\n\n> Ndef_2: Keep in mind that those pods are static so you don't need to kill them. They will be automatically restarted\n\n- Also delete core-dns pod:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns\nNAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\ncoredns-64897985d-7dzkl   1/1     Running   3 (84d ago)   644d\ncoredns-64897985d-rw5kc   1/1     Running   0             83d\n```\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-64897985d-7dzkl  coredns-64897985d-rw5kc  -n kube-system\n```\n\n- Repeat the same procedure for `kubemaster2` and `kubemaster3`\n\n\n> Ndef: incelligent user exists only at kubemaster1, so you dont have to to do actions for this users at kubemaster2 and kubemaster3",

The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`.

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n[[_TOC_]]\n\n# IPVPN\nIP VPN is an application that receives metrics about the network quality for the abc VPN Customers and produces Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding Memory Usage, CPU Load, Provider Edge (PE) Interface, PE Branch Availability and PE Branch Quality of Service (QoS), which are collected and processed by the Service Management (SM) system of abc.\n\nThis is a document that will assist on support. Business documents can be found [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/tree/master/docs).\n\n## Input Performance Data\n\nThere are two source systems, HP Network Node Manager (NNM) and SNMP Custom Poller application, that poll periodically network elements and produces raw files with the instantenous metrics. These files are then parsed by one or more procedures. Finally they are loaded to BigStreamer cluster in Impala tables. There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n\n### Component Metrics\n\n#### Creation of raw files\n\nThe source system in this case is NNM. For high availability there are two instances of NNM on two seperate servers and they operate in active-standby fashion. The whole infrastructure is entirely managed by abc. The raw files produced contain component metrics for CPU load and memory usage of the network elements and are stored in local paths on those servers.\n\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Service: NNM <br> Host: nnmprd01.abc.gr] --> B[File: BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz <br> Path: /var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final <br> Host: nnmprd01.abc.gr]\n  C[Service: NNM <br> Host: nnmdis01.abc.gr] -.->|Stopped| D[File: BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz <br> Path: /var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final <br> Host: nnmdis01.abc.gr]\n```\n\n**Path**: `/var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final` on `nnmprd01.abc.gr` or `nnmdis01.abc.gr`\n\n**File**: `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz`\n\n**Schedule**: `Every 5 minutes`\n\n#### Transfer to BigStreamer nodes\n\nA Perl script executed periodically by user `ipvpn` collects the raw files locally via passwordless SFTP, decompresses them and moves them to a local directory.\n\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[File: BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz <br> Path: /var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final <br> Host: nnmprd01.abc.gr] -->|SFTP| B[Path: /data/1/nnm_components_LZ <br> Host: un2.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: ipvpn]\n  B -->|Decompress/Move|C[Path: /data/1/nnm_components_LZ/spooldir <br> Host: un2.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: ipvpn]\n  D[File: BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz <br> Path: /var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final <br> Host: nnmdis01.abc.gr] -.->|Stopped| B\n```\n\n**User**: `ipvpn`\n\n**Scheduler**: `Cron`\n\n**Schedule**: `Every minute`\n\n**SFTP Path**: `/var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final`\n\n**SFTP user**: `custompoller`\n\n**Intermediate Path**: `/data/1/nnm_components_LZ`\n\n**Destination Path**: `/data/1/nnm_components_LZ/spooldir`\n\n**Logs**: ```/shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.`date +%Y%m%d`.log```\n\n**Configuration**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/DataParser/scripts/transferlist/cpu_mem.trn`\n\n**Script**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/DataParser/scripts/load_data.pl` on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n\n#### Load to BigStreamer cluster\n\nDecompressed files are read on the spot by the Flume agent running on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`.

To manually re-ingest missing data in the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table when a partition has fewer rows than expected, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the missing data**: Determine which partition(s) have fewer rows than expected. You can do this by running a query like: `SELECT par_dt, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM refdata.rd_cells_load GROUP BY par_dt ORDER BY 1;`\n\n2. **Check the log files for errors/exceptions**: Look for any error messages or exceptions that may indicate why the data is missing. You can use commands like: `egrep -i 'error|fail|exception|problem' /shared/abc/refdata/log/210_refData_Load.YYYYMM.log`\n\n3. **Manually re-run the load script**: Once you've identified the issue and checked the log files, you can manually re-run the load script to re-ingest the missing data. You'll need to run a command like: `/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh CELLS <missing_date>` (replace `<missing_date>` with the actual date of the missing data).\n\n4. **Verify that the data has been successfully re-ingested**: After re-running the load script, verify that the data has been successfully re-ingested by running a query like: `SELECT par_dt, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM refdata.rd_cells_load GROUP BY par_dt ORDER BY 1;` (make sure to check the row count for the specific partition that was missing data).

That is, they contain all the historicity of the reference data.  \nThe data of each load is stored in a separate partition identified by the date of the loading (i.e. par_dt=20230530)  \n\n##### Steps 6-7:\nScript `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` reads the most recently added data from the LOAD table and store them as a snapshot into a separate table (aka snapshot tables).  \nThe data of these tables are used for the enrichment of various fact data (i.e. Traffica (SAI))\n\n\n## Manually Run\n`210_refData_Load.sh` script is responsible for the loading of a reference file.\n\nTo run the script two arguments are required  \n`/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh <refType>  <refDate>`  \n\n1st: **\\<refType\\>**, the Reference Type\n```\n- CELLS\n- CRM\n- DEVICES\n- SERVICES\n```\n\n2nd: **\\<refDate\\>**, the date that the flat file contains in its filename  \n\ti.e.\n```\ncells_20220207.csv.gz\ncells_20220208.csv.gz\ncells_20220209.csv.gz\n\nservices_20220207.csv.gz\ndevices_20220208.csv.gz\n\ncrm_20220209.csv.gz\n```\n\nIn case of loading the files above we should execute the following commands\n```\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh CELLS 20220207\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh cells 20220208\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh CELLS 20220209\n\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh services 20220207\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh DEVICES 20220208\n\n/shared/abc/refdata/bin/210_refData_Load.sh crm 20220209\n```\n\nOnce the loads completed, the flat files renamed to <CURRENT_YYYYMMDD>.LOADED\n```\ncells_20220207.csv.20230531.LOADED\ncells_20220208.csv.20230531.LOADED\ncells_20220209.csv.20230531.LOADED\n\nservices_20220207.csv.20230531.LOADED\ndevices_20220208.csv.20230531.LOADED\n\ncrm_20220209.csv.20230531.LOADED\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n**Currently, the Reference Data flow does not support the `Monitoring` services.**  \n\n- An email will be sent by the system with the point of failure.\ni.e.\n```\nSubject: ALERT: Reference data Loading, Type:CELL,  File:cells_20220207.csv\nBody: \n\tReference Type  : CELL\n\tReference File  : cells_20220207.csv\n\tReference Scirpt: 210_refData_Load.sh\n\t------------------------------------------\n\tERROR:$(date '+%F %T'), ALTER TABLE or LOAD DATA command failed.\n```\n\n- Check the log files for errors/exceptions  \n\n```\negrep -i 'error|fail|exception|problem' /shared/abc/refdata/log/210_refData_Load.YYYYMM.log\negrep -i 'error|fail|exception|problem' /shared/abc/refdata/log/220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.YYYYMM.log\n```\n\nIn case of failure follow the instructions described in **`Manually Run`**\n\n### Common errors  \n- Reference data file is empty or the contents of the file is not the expected.  \nIf this is the case, update abc that the file is invalid and ask them to send a new.  \n\n- Other factors not related to the specific flow\n\t- impala/hive availability\n\t- Kerberos authentication\n\t*Ndef: The flow checks if the ticket is still active before any HDFS action.  \n\tIn case of expiration the flow performs a `kinit` command*\n\n## Data Check\n- **Check final tables for new partitions**:\n\t```\n\tsu - intra\n\t\n\t/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k -q \"refresh refdata.rd_cells_load; show partitions refdata.rd_cells_load;\"\n\t\n\t+----------+-----------+--------+---------+\n\t| par_dt   | #Rows     | #Files | Size    |\n\t+----------+-----------+--------+---------+\n\t| 20220227 | 98090     | 1      | 41.88MB |\n\t| 20220228 | 98021     | 1      | 41.84MB |\n\t| 20220301 | 97353     | 1      | 41.76MB |\n\t| Total    | 142404322 | 1500   | 59.63GB |\n\t+----------+-----------+--------+---------+\n\t```\n\n- **Check the amount of data in final tables**:\n\t```\n\tsu - intra\n\t\n\t/usr/bin/impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr --ssl -k -q \"select par_dt, count(*) as cnt from refdata.rd_cells_load group by par_dt order by 1;\"\n\t\n\tpar_dt   | cnt    \n\t---------+--------\n\t20221130 | 2784494\n\t```\n### Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\n\n1.

        "retrieved_context": "# Energy-Efficiency Pollaploi\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is an `Oozie Flow` responsible to **load data** from **txt files** into **impala tables**. Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n\n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n\n## Pollaploi Flow\n\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**\n# Streamsets - Energy Efficiency\n\n## Access\n\nStreamsets Login Page: https://999.999.999.999:18636/\n\nFiles:\n\nFrom un2 with sdc user:\n\n```bash\nsftp bigd@999.999.999.999\ncd /ossrc\n```\n\n## Check for Duplicates\n\nExecute the following from Impala\n\n```bash\nselect count(*), par_dt from energy_efficiency.cell where par_dt>'202111201' group by par_dt order by par_dt desc;\n```\n\n```bash\nselect count(*) from (select distinct * from energy_efficiency.cell where par_dt='20211210') a;\n```\n\n## Solve Duplicates\n\nExecute the following from Impala\n\nBackup table:\n```bash\nCREATE TABLE  energy_efficiency.cell LIKE energy_efficiency.cell;\nINSERT INTO TABLE energy_efficiency.cell_bak PARTITION (par_dt) SELECT * FROM energy_efficiency.cell;\n```\n\nModify table:\n```bash\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE energy_efficiency.cell partition (par_dt)\n\tSELECT DISTINCT * FROM energy_efficiency.cell\n\tWHERE par_dt between '20211210' and '20211215';\n```\n\nDrop Backup table:\n```bash\nDROP TABLE energy_efficiency.cell;\n```",

Check for failed executions\n\n    From `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal user:\n\n    ```bash\n    curl --location --request GET 'http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800/monitoring/api/jobstatus/find?application=RADIUS&status=FAILED&operativePartition=<date in YYYYMMDD e.g.:20220518>'\n    ```\n\n    For additional query parameters check [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/common-dev/apps/monitoring/monitoring-devops/-/wikis/API-Functional-Spec#fields)\n\n    or check via the corresponding [Grafana dashboard](https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/J4KPyBoVk/radius-dashboard?orgId=1&from=now-2d&to=now)\n\n  - Check the logs for the failed execution.\n- After the underlying problem has been corrected the next execution of the flow will load any files that have been delayed or failed to be loaded in a previous execution.\n- If the customer requests to load specific files after they have been processed by the flow. **In order to avoid duplicate data we have to reload the whole partition.**\n  -

A failure of the NameNode can render the entire HDFS cluster unavailable.\n    2. **Impact on BigStreamer components**:\n        * **HDFS**: The failure of the NameNode affects the availability of HDFS, which is used by BigStreamer for storing data.\n        * **HBase**: As HBase relies on HDFS for storage, the unavailability of HDFS due to the NameNode failure also impacts HBase.\n        * **Oozie**: Oozie, a workflow management system, relies on HDFS and HBase for storing and managing workflow data. The unavailability of these components due to the NameNode failure affects Oozie's functionality.\n\n    # Fixed solution:\n    To recover BigStreamer after a NameNode failure affecting HDFS, HBase, and Oozie, follow these steps:\n\n    1. **Recover the NameNode**:\n        * If the NameNode is down due to a hardware or software issue, address the root cause of the problem.\n        * If the NameNode is corrupted or its metadata is inconsistent, you may need to restore the NameNode from a backup or rebuild it from scratch.\n\n    2. **Recover HDFS**:\n        * Once the NameNode is recovered, you can start the HDFS cluster.\n        * If any DataNodes are down or corrupted, address these issues before starting the HDFS cluster.\n\n    3. **Recover HBase**:\n        * After HDFS is recovered, you can start the HBase cluster.\n        * If any RegionServers are down or corrupted, address these issues before starting the HBase cluster.\n\n    4. **Recover Oozie**:\n        * Once HDFS and HBase are recovered, you can start the Oozie server.\n        * If any Oozie workflows or coordinators are affected by the NameNode failure, you may need to re-run or re-schedule these workflows or coordinators.\n\n    # Explanation of changes:\n    The steps outlined above involve recovering the BigStreamer ecosystem after a NameNode failure. This includes:\n\n    * Recovering the NameNode and addressing any underlying issues that caused the failure.\n    * Recovering HDFS, which involves starting the HDFS cluster and ensuring that all DataNodes are operational.\n    * Recovering HBase, which involves starting the HBase cluster and ensuring that all RegionServers are operational.\n    * Recovering Oozie, which involves starting the Oozie server and ensuring that all workflows and coordinators are operational.\n\n    By following these steps, you can recover the BigStreamer ecosystem after a NameNode failure and ensure that all components are operational and functioning correctly.",

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle.

You can do this by checking the SFTP server for files that were not processed. Retrieve these files and ensure they are in the correct format and location for processing.\n\n3. **Drop affected partitions**: Drop the partitions in the `radarchive` and `radacct` tables that correspond to the date range when the system was down. This will remove any incomplete or corrupted data from those partitions.\n\n4. **Reload missed files**: Once the affected partitions have been dropped, reload the missed files into the system. Ensure that these files are processed correctly and that the data is loaded into the appropriate tables.\n\n5. **Resume the coordinator**: After all missed files have been reprocessed and loaded into the system, resume the `Radius_Load_Coordinator`. This will allow the system to return to its normal operation and process new files as they become available.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that any missed RADIUS files are properly reprocessed and loaded into the system, maintaining data integrity and completeness.",

CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.",

 \n\t- the `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL` table, used to synchronize the **Export** procedure with the **Import** procedure.  \n\nThe data in `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL` is similar to the

The **Export** procedure is implemented by def/abc.  \n\tIt is responsible to prepare the data in Oracle tables (see Oracle Table list in [Data Source Tables](#data-source-tables))  \n\tOnce completed, it updates the `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` column with the current system's timestamp.   \n\tNdef: It is not known how often the **Export** procedure runs.\n\n2.  The **Import** procedure is implemented by jkl.  \n\tIt checks periodically if the value of `def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT` has been updated.  \n\t- In case of new value, the procedure exports the data from the Oracle tables  \n\t`./oracle_cmd.sh \"select * from <table>\" > ./<table>.exp`  \n\t- stores them into HDFS  \n\t`hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal ./<table>.exp .`\n\t- and, consequently, load them into the corresponding [Hive Tables](#hive-tables).  \n\t*Connect to Beeline (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`Beeline <connection> -e \"load data inpath './<table>.exp' overwrite into table <table>;\"`\n\t- Once the Import procedure completed, the `IMPORT_START_DT` column will be updated with the current system's timestamp.   \n\t*Connect to Oracle (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`update def_NETWORK_MAP.EXPORT_CTL.EXPORT_START_DT`\n\t- Compute table statistics using impala-shell\t \n\t*Connect to Impala (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*\n\t`compute incremental stats brond.brond_retrains_hist;`\n\n3. In case the `EXPORT_START_DT` value isn't updated, the **Import** procedure exists doing nothing.\n\n## Monitoring\n\n### Monitoring connection details\n|Field|Value|\n|-|-|\n|Database Type| mysql  \n|Host| 999.999.999.999  \n|DB Name| monitoring  \n|DB User| monitoring  \n|Table| jobstatus  \n\nConnection command: `/usr/bin/mysql -u monitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999 monitoring`\n\n\n### Monitoring Message list\nFor each load for each TABLE the following set of messages will be recorded in the Monitoring database.\n```\nexecution_id | id     | application | job             | component                 | operative_partition | status  | system_ts           | system_ts_end       | param0 | message                                                              | user             | host                    \n-------------+--------+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+---------------------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------------------\n1670509202   | 402171 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | MAIN                      | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:02 | 2022-12-08 16:22:05 |        | Procedure Started                                                    | def_network_maps | un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr\n1670509202   | 402173 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | CHECK_FOR_AVAILABLE_DATA  | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:02 |                     |        | New data found: 2022-12-08 15:50:04                                  | def_network_maps | un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr\n1670509202   | 402207 | ONETICKET   | def_NETWORK_MAP | EXPORT_DATA-<TABLE-NAME>  | 20221208_1620       | SUCCESS | 2022-12-08 16:20:24 |                     | 6987   | Oracle export def_NETWORK_MAP.OPEN_NTT data.

        "chatbot_response": " The provided context does not include information about recovering the `radius.radarchive_hist` table when a file is missing or corrupted. However, based on the general flow and troubleshooting steps outlined in the context, here are some potential recovery steps that could be explored:\n\n1. **Identify the Missing or Corrupted File**: Determine which specific file is missing or corrupted. This can be done by checking the logs for any error messages related to file loading or processing.\n\n2. **Check for File Availability on SFTP Server**: Verify if the missing or corrupted file is available on the SFTP server. If it is, proceed with reloading the file into the system.\n\n3. **Reload the Missing or Corrupted File**: Once the availability of the file on the SFTP server has been confirmed, reload the file into the system. This may involve running a specific job or workflow that is designed to load files from the SFTP server into the `radius.radarchive_hist` table.\n\n4. **Verify Data Integrity and Consistency**: After reloading the missing or corrupted file, verify that the data in the `radius.radarchive_hist` table is accurate, complete, and consistent. This may involve running queries to check for any discrepancies or anomalies in the data.\n\nBy following these steps, it should be possible to recover the `radius.radarchive_hist` table when a file is missing or corrupted. However, please note that these steps are based on general principles and may need to be adapted to fit the specific requirements and constraints of your system.",

AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.",

These tables seem to fill up throughout the day, so the stats don't appear to be up to date.\\nThe statistics refer to data in partitions of previous days.\\n\\n- In terms of performance, it is not possible to run compute statistics on partitions that continuously receive data during the day.\\nThere are streams that load data every 5 minutes.\\nDoing so would significantly delay data processing.\\n\\n- Obviously, the queries that are executed include the current partition and that is why the Warning for missing statistics is displayed.\\nAttached you will find an example for sai.sms_raw for different par_dt, in which it appears that for historical data no warning is displayed.\\n\\nIf statistics are needed for specific tables, we should consider it as a project and not under Support. We should consider how the performance of the cluster is affected and make the right design, so that we can agree on the frequency that the statistics should be calculated.\\n\\n\\n<b>Title :\tfurther actions have also been made </b>",
        "chatbot_response": " You can fix corrupted statistics in Impala tables by running the `COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS` command on the affected table. This will recalculate and update the statistics for the table.\n\n    For example, to fix corrupted statistics for the `sai.sms_raw` table, you would run the following command:\n    ```sql\nCOMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS sai.sms_raw;\n```\n    Similarly, to fix corrupted statistics for the `brond.td_dslam_week` table, you would run the following command:\n    ```sql\nCOMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS brond.td_dslam_week;\n```\n    After running these commands, the corrupted statistics should be fixed, and the tables should be properly optimized for querying.",

Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n\n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n\n## Pollaploi Flow\n\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**\n# Datawarehouse ibank\n\n## Extract\n\n**Extraction of detail tables**\n\nOur spark application will extract information from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit table to different detail tables based on different service names with the help of lookup table service_name where needed. The columns of the detail tables are produced either from a non json column of the input table (eg. client_username) or from parsing the json fields request_text_data and response_text_data and extracting specific fields based on their name. When two fields have the same name then we will keep the greater value either for a number field or for a string based on lexicographic order.\nThese jobs are executed by the bank's scheduler. There is an agent installed on the BDA edge node which is called UC4.
