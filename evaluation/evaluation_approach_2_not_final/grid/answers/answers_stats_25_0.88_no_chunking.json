        "chatbot_response": " The provided context does not directly address the causes of a YARN Node Manager failure or how it can be mitigated. However, it provides information on various logs and troubleshooting steps for different applications and services.\n\n     To answer the question based on general knowledge of YARN and Hadoop ecosystems:\n\n     A YARN Node Manager failure can be caused by various factors such as resource constraints (e.g., memory, CPU), configuration issues, network connectivity problems, or software bugs.\n\n     To mitigate a YARN Node Manager failure, several steps can be taken:\n     1. **Monitor Resources**: Ensure that the Node Manager has sufficient resources (memory, CPU) to operate effectively.\n     2. **Review Configuration**: Verify that the YARN and Node Manager configurations are correct and appropriate for the cluster's workload and size.\n     3. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that there are no network connectivity issues between the Node Manager and other components of the Hadoop ecosystem, such as the Resource Manager or DataNodes.\n     4. **Apply Software Updates**: Keep the YARN and Hadoop software up to date with the latest patches and updates, which often include bug fixes and performance improvements.\n     5. **Implement Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems for the YARN Node Manager and other critical components of the Hadoop ecosystem. This will help in quickly identifying and responding to issues before they escalate into more serious problems.\n\n    By following these steps, you can mitigate YARN Node Manager failures and ensure the reliability and performance of your Hadoop cluster.",

The dublicate key value is (e5435435-4354254235-121nfdgd33)`\\n\\n\\nThat means that the table already has records in it, so we have to drop this records or invoke the script with the `-f` option that gives the ability to trancate the table and then insert the records. \\n\\n```\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t manDate -f\\n```\\n\\nAfter executing the extract script, we use the same `-f` to run the export script. The reason that we are running export is because in the above mentioned step we run the extract and trancated the table so the export is neccessary. \\n\\n```\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_export_details.sh -t manDate -f\\n```\\n\\nThe issue has been resolved by executing the above two commands. The key in this case was to find in the logs that we have dublicate keys. ",

The malfunction of the live streams is also the problem you observed last night.\\n\\nWe propose as a workaround today after 9pm. disable quotas in the PROD_IBANK namespace and rerun the script without the single node limitation, so that the load is shared across all 9 available Impala daemons. We will then examine the alternatives for modifying the flow and re-enabling quotas.\\n\\nThere is no downtime required for the above actions.\\n\\nIf you need further information we can arrange a call.\\n\\nG.

Login to Cloudera for PR Site \\n2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.\\n   \\n   ![logs_screenshot](.media/upsert_to_hbase_logs_query.PNG)\\n   > Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.\\n\\n3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well\\n4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.\\n   1. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query\\n   2. From the url that we monitor the query\\n5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond\\n6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality\\n7. Upon investigation, we concluded that the change to `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` that stops the parallel execution of the query by Impala daemons (set num_nodes = 1) was the cause of the problem\\n8. We scheduled to rerun the `Upsert to HBase` stage the following day after reverting the script to use all Impala daemons for parallel execution.\\n9.  On 03/03/2023 \\n   - we disabled HBase quotas for ` PROD_IBANK` namespace on PR Site according to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/22263_mno_HBASE_TUNING.docx) MoP\\n   - we removed `set num_nodes = 1` from `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`\\n   - reran the script\\n10.

We have to check first the logs from the failed job `Enrich SA from SA_old` as described [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#distinct-join-to-service-audit)\\n\\nDetailed information from the above link\\n\\n**User**: `PRODREST`\\n\\n**Script Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_service_audit_insert_join_distinct.log`\\n\\n**Script**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_service_audit_insert_join_distinct.sh` on `dr1edge01.mno.gr`/`pr1edge01.mno.gr` (each edge server submits to a different cluster)\\n\\n\\n2.

Login to Grafana and make sure that the failed step is the Merge Batch.\\n2. Login to DR/PR edge nodes and through the node's firefox check YARN at https://dr1node03:8090 and https://pr1node03:8090 for the PROD_Ibank merge batch job.\\n3. Check the stages tab for stages that have been completed for this job. At PR the `insert into` stages had completed after 8h. The RDD stages had failed and continued failing.\\n![Yarn UI](.media/IM2285747_1.png)\\n![Spark Stages](.media/IM2285747_2.png)\\n4. The 8 hour mark gives us some clues as to the failure. In essence after 8 hours kerberos tickets are dropped, leading to continuous authentication failures and timeouts as shown in the logs `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log`.\\n5. Checked the merge batch logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_v2.log` and `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log` and indeed we found authorization errors.\\n6. Checked the size and count of the `service_audit_old` table through Impala and HDFS and it was found to be among the largest ever both in size (over 115 GB) and count (60 mil). The query used is `select  count(*) from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old where par_dt=20240229`.\\n7. Inspecting the submition script we can see that for each individual sub-script the date is generated anew in the sub-script invocation. This means that since the merge in question spanned multiple dates, all steps started after the day's end wouldn't have completed succesfully.\\n8. Inspecting the range partitions through Impala with the query `show range partitions prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream`, we can find multiple leftover range partitions since November. This added further computation time for the already large table.\\n\\nInvestigation for 05/03:\\n\\nFor this day, while the size and count were not unusually large the last step of the process, ie. the\\nhbase upsert took unusually long and couldn't complete on its own. The process seemed to get stuck on 1\\nsingular task as shown by the logs at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log`, which leads us to conclude that a certain record was problematic because all tasks completed\\nnormally except a specific one that kept failling even on re-runs.\\n\\nInvestigation - Summary:\\n\\n- Greater than most end of the month dates size(over 115 GB) and count (60 mil)\\n- Multiple leftover range partitions\\n- Execution spanning multiple days, triggering the dynamic date issue with the submition script\\n- Stage execution surpassing the 8 hour mark, triggering a known kerberos authorization bug\\n- Problematic record for 05/03\\n\\n<b>Resolution:</b>\\n\\n1. Since the data was already loaded into PR for 29/2, the rest of the steps were executed manually on it\\n   according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#batch instructions for\\n   steps beyond the Merge Batch .\\n2. For all the remaining dates since 29/2 and because the cron jobs were stopped, each day was executed\\n   manually in full in each site, half of them (days) in PR and half of them (days) in DR following\\n   all the steps in the sub-steps guide from https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md .\\n3. For each job completed in one site it was replicated over to the other using HDFS replication, through\\n   the destination's Cloudera Manager for both `service_audit` and `service_audit_old` tables. **A similar\\n   procedure for table replication exists in [Table Replication](./20201218-IM1389913.md) but not for HDFS replication.**\\n   - /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit_old/par_dt=$date\\n   - /mno_data/hive/warehouse/prod_trlog_ibank.db/service_audit/par_dt=$date\\n4. Once replicated the HBase Upsert step was run on the destination site according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\\n5. HBase markers were manually set for each job that didn't complete automatically according to https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md?ref_type=heads#upsert-to-hbase-migration .\\n6. Kudu range partitions were cleaned up manually for all previous days and 3 new partitions were created\\n   for the 3 previous days, in order for the cleanup script to continue functioning as nornal. More details\\n   on this can be found at the end of this document.\\n\\n\\nResolution for 05/03 HBase Upsert:\\n\\nFor this operation specifically more resources had to be allocated to the spark-submit job at `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert/submitVisibleTrnToHbaseIndexesDailyUpsert_STABLE.sh`. After its completion resources were reverted back to normal:\\n```\\nIncrease node count to 12\\nDecrease core count to 1\\nIncrease tasks to 40\\n```\\n\\nKudu Range Partitions:\\n\\nRange partitions are created for the `service_audit_stream` table on the `u_timestamp` column. The commands to create and delete them\\ncan be found below for some example dates. Ndef that those partitions are in UTC time, so the time to\\ncreate/drop must be converted to local time, taking into account DST. For winter we are at GMT+2 so in order\\nto include a full day it must range for 22:00 of the previous to 22:00 of the current (where current is the day you want to delete).\\n\\n```sh\\n# Drop\\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream drop range partition '2023-02-26T22:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-27T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\\n\\n# Create\\nalter table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream add range partition '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z' <= VALUES < '2023-02-28T22:00:00.000000Z' ;\\n```\\n\\nThe example above includes the first partition, which tracks from 1970 to the date in question. When deleting previous partitions, the first one\\nmust be recreated in order to include the time from 1970 to the first date, and then you can create the daily partitions. For example, lets say we have\\nthe following partitions:\\n\\n```\\n| 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-11-29T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one in order to include a bigger range\\n| 2023-11-29T22:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-11-30T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one due to policy\\n| 2023-11-30T22:00:00.000000Z <= VALUES < 2023-12-01T22:00:00.000000Z | # We want to drop this one because it contains trash.

Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account and then to `dr1node01.mno.gr`\\n2. Move to the process folder:\\n```bash\\ncd /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/\\n```\\n3. Find the latest process and go to that folder. In our case is 12200-kudu-KUDU_TSERVER. So move to that folder:\\n```bash\\ncd 12200-kudu-KUDU_TSERVER\\n```\\n4. Use the keytab you just found in that folder:\\n```bash\\nkinit -kt kudu.keytab kudu/`hostname`\\n```\\n5. Check kudu cluster health and specifically for `prod_trlog_card_analytical` database in order to check if the wanted table is created.\\n```bash\\nkudu cluster ksck dr1node04.mno.gr dr1node05.mno.gr dr1node06.mno.gr | grep -i prod_trlog_card_analytical\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see the `prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp` table is not created.\\n\\n**Optional**: You can also verify that from impala-shell running the following commands:\\n- Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account\\n- impala-shell -i dr1edge01 -k --ssl\\n- `[dr1edge01.mno.gr:21000] default> use prod_trlog_card_analytical;`\\n- `[dr1edge01.mno.gr:21000] default> show tables;`\\n\\nAs you can see the `prod_trlog_card_analytical.opticash_dispencing_atm_tmp` table is not created.\\n\\n6.

Restart the three kudu masters (one at a time)\\n4. After rerunning the query the table is not still created but this time we get the following error: \\n```bash\\nSASL decode failed: SASL(-1): generic failure:\\nwO706 15:44:11.242372 109675 hms_notification_log_listener.cc:130] Hive Metastore notification log listener poll failed: Not authorized: failed to ret\\nrieve notification log events: failed to get Hive Metastore next notification: SASL decode failed: SASL(-1): generie failure:\\nw0706 15:44:35.127687 109673 hms_client.cc:345] Time spent get HMS notification events: real 8.885s user 0.000s sys 0.228s\\n```\\n\\n5.

This approach allows you to process smaller chunks of data, reducing the load on Kudu and minimizing the likelihood of scan timeouts. Additionally, you can also adjust the values in the submit script to optimize the performance of the Spark job. \n\nFor example, you can run the following command to process a specific time range:\n```bash\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh \"2019-11-09 00:00:00\" \"2019-11-09 12:00:00\"\n```\nBy processing smaller chunks of data, you can reduce the load on Kudu and minimize the likelihood of scan timeouts. \n\nAdditionally, you can also adjust the values in the submit script to optimize the performance of the Spark job. For example, you can increase the number of executors or the amount of memory allocated to each executor. \n\nBy optimizing the performance of the Spark job and reducing the load on Kudu, you can minimize the likelihood of scan timeouts and ensure that your data is processed efficiently and reliably. \n\nIt's also important to monitor the performance of your Spark jobs and Kudu cluster, and to adjust your configuration and optimization strategies as needed to ensure optimal performance and reliability. \n\nIn summary, to reduce the risk of Kudu scan timeouts during Spark MergeBatch jobs, you can consider running the MergeBatch for parts of the day, adjusting the values in the submit script to optimize the performance of the Spark job, and monitoring the performance of your Spark jobs and Kudu cluster to adjust your configuration and optimization strategies as needed. \n\nBy following these strategies, you can minimize the likelihood of scan timeouts and ensure that your data is processed efficiently and reliably. \n\nIt's also important to note that the specific strategies and optimizations that are most effective will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your use case, as well as the characteristics and performance of your Spark jobs and Kudu cluster. \n\nTherefore, it's recommended to carefully evaluate and test different strategies and optimizations

These files are then parsed by one or more procedures. Finally they are loaded to BigStreamer cluster in Impala tables. There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files",

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\\n\\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\\n# Application Flow\\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\\n\\n### IPVPN-SLA\\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\\n\\n### IPVPN-SM\\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\\n## IPVPN-SM Application\\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\\n\\n### Ingestion Endpoint\\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`.

Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\\n\\n### Auto-retry mechanism\\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\\n\\n\\n# Support\\n\\n## Check request status via Monitoring\\n### Grafana\\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\\n\\n### Monitoring DB\\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request.

The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \\n2.

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n## Resolution Steps\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### AppQueryIngestionException\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective.

The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\\n\\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\\n\\n## Flows\\n\\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\\n1.

The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\\n\\n``` mermaid\\n flowchart TD\\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\\n```\\n\\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\\n  - **User:** `temip`\\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\\n\\n**Alerts:**\\n\\n- **Not Monitored**\\n\\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\\n\\n1.

Workflows:\\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \\n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\\n\\n1. `Sanity Checks`\\n\\n    1.

In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\\n\\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\\n\\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\\n\\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\\n\\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \\n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \\n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\\n\\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \\n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \\nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\\n\\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \\n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \\nwhere v is the wrong partition.\\n\\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\\n\\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\\n    ``` bash\\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \\\"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\\\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \\\"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\\\"\\n    ```\\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\\n\\n    Example for day 20220501:\\n    ``` bash\\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \\\"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\\\" identifier 30 20230104 \\\"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\\\"\\n    ```\\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\\n\\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\\n\\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \\n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\\n\\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\\n\\n        ``` sql\\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\\n        \\\"Terminated-Oracle\\\" state,\\n        \\\"Closed\\\" problem_status,\\n        case when clearancereportflag = \\\"1\\\" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\\n        handledby as handled_by,\\n        closedby as closed_by,\\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\\n        null previous_state,\\n        managedobject as managed_object,\\n        targetentities as target_entities,\\n        --targetentities60512 as target_entities,\\n        alarmtype as alarm_type,\\n        eventtime as event_time,\\n        probablecause as probable_cause,\\n        securityalarmcause as security_alarm_cause,\\n        specificproblems as specific_problems,\\n        --specificproblems (id)-8eloume to join kai edw,\\n        null backed_up_status,\\n        backupobject as backup_object,\\n        trendindication as trend_indication,\\n        thresholdinfo as threshold_info,\\n        cast(notificationidentifier as bigint) notification_identifier,\\n        correlnotifinfo as correl_notif_info,\\n        monitoredattributes as monitored_attributes,\\n        proposedrepairactions as proposed_repair_actions,\\n        null additional_information,\\n        domain as domain,\\n        securityalarmdetector as security_Alarm_Detector,\\n        null service_User,\\n        null service_Provider,\\n        ocname as oc_Name,\\n        cast(parentalarmobject as bigint) parent_alarm_object,\\n        null severity_changed_time_stamp,\\n        alarmcomment as alarm_comment,\\n        agentalarmidentifier as agent_alarm_identifier,\\n        agententity as agent_entity,\\n        perceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\\n        0 useridentifier,\\n        usertext as user_Text,\\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\\n        null deleted,\\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\\n        --,*\\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\\n        ```\\n\\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \\n\\n    1.

If files were missing the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded.  \\n        Before manually executing the script in this case, check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log.\\n        \\n        - If 5 or more files weren't exported execute the script with the `--max-files <N>` flag.  \\n        This will instruct the script to catch-up meaning to export files for N 2-hour intervals.  \\n        This is not needed if 4 or less files were missed in which case the procedure will automatically catch up.  \\n        For example if 6 files were not exported run:\\n        \\n            ``` bash\\n            /shared/abc/location_mobility/run/renew/export_lm_lte_v2_mon.sh --max-files 6 >> /shared/abc/location_mobility/log/lm_export_lte_v2_mon.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1\\n            ```\\n        \\n        - If you need to export files for a specific date execute the script with the `-t <yyyymmdd>` flag.

If any of the issues mentioned below happen, firstly follow the general troubleshooting steps to identify the problem that occurred and then follow the steps which correspond to fixing the issue. \n---\n#### Check file(s) has been loaded correctly\nLogin to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` and change to `sdc` user.\n1. Grep `A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline` for JVM errors:\n        ```\n        cat sdc.log | grep -i 'A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline'\n        ```\n        > ERROR ProductionPipelineRunnable - A JVM error occurred while running the pipeline, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap     space java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n    1. Grep `ERROR` for any errors that might occur.\n```bash\n   cluster -> Streamsets -> Restart\n   ```\n4. Check Streamsets Process Options\n   ```bash\n   [root@un2 ~]# ps -ef | grep -i streamsets | grep -i xmx\n1. Open a pipeline. Check the generic summary (click anywhere in the board and select summary) to get an overview through dashboards on the data processed and errors. Also check if any job of the pipeline has errors (click on an action box and select tab Errors). Streamset will provide a specific ERROR message.\n**Step 2:** Look at the `logs`.\n**TO VIEW THE LOG FILE FOR A SPECIFIC PIPELINE:** `cat sdc.log | grep -i '<pipeline-grep-keyword>'`\nConcurrent Mark-Sweep GC\n   Heap Configuration:\n      MinHeapFreeRatio         = 40\n      MaxHeapFreeRatio         = 70\n      MaxHeapSize              = 34359738368 (32768.0MB)\n      NewSize                  = 2442723328 (2329.5625MB)\n      MaxNewSize               = 2442723328 (2329.5625MB)\n      OldSize                  = 31917015040 (30438.4375MB)\n      NewRatio                 = 2\n      SurvivorRatio            = 8\n      MetaspaceSize            = 21807104 (20.796875MB)",

If the count is greater than zero, it indicates that the metrics are being loaded into the table.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check the logs of the IPVPN-SM script and app to see if there are any errors or issues with loading the metrics.\n\nBy checking the metrics load and the logs of the IPVPN-SM script and app, you can confirm whether the Fraport branch probes are properly loaded into `bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist`.",

These files are usually stored in a specific directory on the SFTP server.\n\n3. **Rename the files to be reprocessed**: Rename the located RADIUS files by removing any suffix that might indicate they have already been processed (e.g., `.LOADED`). This step is crucial because the system will only reprocess files that do not have a processed suffix.\n\n4. **Trigger the reprocessing workflow**: After renaming the files, trigger the workflow that is responsible for processing RADIUS files. This can usually be done through a scheduler like Apache Airflow or by manually triggering the workflow through a web interface or command line.\n\n5. **Monitor the reprocessing job**: Once the reprocessing workflow has been triggered, monitor the job to ensure it completes successfully. Check for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with the reprocessing job.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully reprocess RADIUS files for missing data during system downtime.",

This might involve reviewing the workflow configuration, checking for any errors or exceptions that might have led to the incorrect marking.\n\n4. **Restore the missing file**: Once the cause of the missing file and its incorrect marking as processed has been identified and addressed, restore the missing hourly RADIUS file to its correct location.\n\n5. **Re-run the workflow (if necessary)**: Depending on the specific requirements of your workflow and how files are processed, you might need to re-run the `Radius_Load_Workflow` with appropriate parameters to ensure that the restored file is correctly processed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to detect and restore a missing hourly RADIUS file that was incorrectly marked as processed.",

        "chatbot_response": " To fix corrupted statistics in Impala tables like `sai.sms_raw` and `brond.td_dslam_week`, you can use the following approaches:\n\n1. **Recompute Statistics**: You can recompute the statistics for the affected tables using the `COMPUTE STATS` statement in Impala. For example:\n```sql\nCOMPUTE STATS sai.sms_raw;\nCOMPUTE STATS brond.td_dslam_week;\n```\n2. **Check and Repair Table Metadata**: Corrupted table metadata can also cause issues with statistics. You can check and repair table metadata using the `INVALIDATE METADATA` statement in Impala. For example:\n```sql\nINVALIDATE METADATA sai.sms_raw;\nINVALIDATE METADATA brond.td_dslam_week;\n```\n3. **Recreate Table Statistics**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can try recreating the table statistics from scratch.

You can check and repair table metadata using the `INVALIDATE METADATA` statement in Impala.\n3. **Recreate Table Statistics**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can try recreating the table statistics from scratch.\n\nNote that recreating table statistics from scratch can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, especially for large tables.
