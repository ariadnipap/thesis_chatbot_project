        "category": "Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution",
        "expected_answer": "To resolve the EXPORT job failure due to a duplicate key, first check for duplicate entries in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg` using Impala Shell. Then, create backup and temp tables, remove the duplicate entry by ID and timestamp, and overwrite the original table. Finally, rerun the export script:\\n```bash\\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment\\n```",

        "chatbot_response": " The provided context does not contain information about batch job failures or loan payment data exports. However, it does describe procedures for stopping streaming and batch procedures, migrating traffic between DR/PR sites, and migrating UC4 flows. \n\n     If a batch job fails with Code 6 while trying to EXPORT loan payment data, the cause could be related to issues with data consistency, database connections, or export configuration. To resolve this issue, it would be necessary to investigate the specific error messages and logs associated with the failed batch job, and then take corrective actions to address the underlying causes of the failure.\n\n    In general, when dealing with batch job failures, it's essential to follow a structured approach to troubleshooting, which includes:\n\n    1. Reviewing error messages and logs to identify the specific cause of the failure.\n    2. Checking the configuration and setup of the batch job to ensure that it is correct and consistent with the requirements of the job.\n    3. Investigating any issues with data consistency, database connections, or export configuration that may be contributing to the failure of the batch job.\n    4.

Streaming and batch procedures are running in both sites. External traffic and UC4 flows however are only active in one of them. \n\n## Procedure\n\n### Stop streaming procedures\n\n1.

Start `prodreston` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n3. Ask for a mno Network administrator to make a call.\n   \n4. Ask them to enable the new servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to enable as explained [here](manage_wildfly.md#consolidated-network-information)).\n   \n5. Check logs for both Wildfly instances at both servers to ensure everything works.\n   \n6. When you are certain everything is OK, ask the mno Network administrators to disable the prexisting servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to disable).\n   \n7. From the access logs of the prexisting Wildfly instances check that no traffic is received. \n   \n8. Stop these Wildfly instances as described in the procedures [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib) and [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n### Migrate UC4 flows between PR/DR\n\n1. Login to the edge servers of the active and passive site using your personal account and become `root`.\n\n2. Stop UC4 agent at the edge nodes of the active site.\n   \n  ``` bash\n  systemctl stop uc4agent\n  ```\n\n3. Start service for UC4 agent at the edge servers of the passive site.\n\n  ``` bash\n  systemctl start uc4agent\n  ```\n\n4.

Also we need to Enable Job ACL JobHistory Server Default Group\n\n2. Spark configuration\n\nGo to spark --> configuration then search for \"Spark Client Advanced Configuration Snippet\"\n\nThen enable spark acl by adding the following line:\n\n`spark.acls.enable=true`\n\n& enable the acls for admin groups\n\n`spark.admins.acls.groups=WBDADMIN`\n\nAlso add the following in order to give permissions to spark history server into a group\n\n`spark.history.ui.admin.acls.groups=WBDADMIN`\n\nLastly, add the following which is the groups\n\n`spark.ui.view.acls.groups=WBDOPDEV,WBDOPPRO,WBDOPQA`\n# Below procedure describes how to decrypt an encrypted disk\n\n\n###### Back up \nBackup data of encrypted disk\n\n>Ndef_1: In our case we don't have data in this partition.

        "expected_answer": "A Node Manager failure on pr1node01 was due to excessive disk usage from krb5kdc logs. These logs had grown to 80GB. The mitigation included deleting old logs and changing log rotation policy to weekly, keeping only 7 logs instead of 12.",
        "context": "# mno - BigStreamer - IM2095156 - Alarm on PRDBA  Cloudera Manager\\n\\n</b>Description:</b>\\n\\n```\\nWe have a critical alarm in PRDBA Cloudera Manager -\\n\\nYARM -- Node Manager (pr1node03)\\nProcess Status\\n\\nThank you\\n```\\n\\n<b>Actions Taken:</b>\\n\\n1. Login to Cloudera UI for the PR Site\\n2. Cloudera > Yarn\\n3. Upon inspection we noticed that the alert was about pr1node01 (Node Manager) and not pr1node03 (JobHistory Server)\\n4. Ssh pr1node01 and inspect logs at /var/loh/hadoop-yarn. We could not find the root cause from logs\\n5. Restart the Node Manager role for the specific node. After the restart the alert disappeared.\\n6. During further investigation, from Cloudera UI we saw that prior to ```Process Status``` alert there was a ```NODE_MANAGER_LOG_FREE_SPACE``` alert\\n7. From pr1node01 as root `df -h /`. The usage of `/` was at 98% at that time\\n8. Upon inspection we noticed that the krb5kdc logs had increased over the last months peaking the monthly log file to ~80G.\\n9. We proceeded to the removal of krb5kdc log files for 2022.\\n10. As a permanent solution, we implemented changes to retention policy for krb5kdc logs. Specifically, we changed the rotation to weekly from monthly and the storage to 7 old logs from 12 logs files that it was prior the change.  This change was implemented at pr1node02, dr1node01 and dr1node02 as well.\\n\\n\\n    ![logrotate_krb5kdc](.media/IM2095156/IM2095156_logrotate_krb5kdc.PNG)\\n\\n<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>\\n\\n```\\n09/03/23 15:47:41 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\\nGood evening,\\n\\nFollowing the investigation, we have changed the retention for krb5kdc logs. Specifically, we have set the rotation to be weekly instead of monthly and to keep 7 log files. Note that the monthly krb5kdc log file had reached 80G.\\n\\nPlease let us know if we can proceed with closing the ticket.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\n01/03/23 07:16:41 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):\\nGood morning,\\n\\nThere was a malfunction in the yarn node manager since 3.42, resulting in the ibank and online streaming topologies falling as recorded in ticket SD2157107.\\n\\nWe proceeded to restart at 4:53 to get it back up. During the restart, the online merge batch crashed, which was resubmitted (related ticket SD2157111).\\n\\nAt this time, yarn and the flows are running normally.\\n\\nFrom the investigation it appears that the root partition on pr1node01 had filled up, which was caused by the local kdc logs. We have proceeded to clean the corresponding log files and are investigating changes to the retention of the logs to avoid future problems.\\n\\nPlease let us know if you consider the workaround acceptable.\\n\\nThank you\\n```",
