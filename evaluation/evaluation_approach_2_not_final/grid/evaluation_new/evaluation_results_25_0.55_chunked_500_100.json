Identify the failed disk and replace it with a new one.\n2. Format the new disk and configure it as a part of the DataNode.\n3. Restart the DataNode service to ensure that the new disk is recognized and used by the system.\n4. Run the HDFS `fsck` command to check the integrity of the file system and identify any potential issues or inconsistencies.\n5. If any issues are identified during the `fsck` process, take corrective action to resolve the problems and ensure the integrity and consistency of the file system.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to handle and recover from a failed disk replacement on a DataNode in HDFS. \n\nHowever, please note that the specific steps and procedures may vary depending on your specific environment, configuration, and requirements.
