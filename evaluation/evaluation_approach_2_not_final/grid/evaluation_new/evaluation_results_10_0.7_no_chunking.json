        "chatbot_answer": " # Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **Identify the failed job**: The first step is to identify which Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank has failed.\n2. **Check the logs**: Check the logs of the failed job to determine the cause of the failure.\n3. **Determine the necessary actions**: Based on the cause of the failure, determine the necessary actions to take in order to rerun the job successfully.\n\n# Fixed solution:\n```bash\n# Rerun the Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank\n/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t mergeBatch\n```\n\n# Explanation of changes:\n* **Rerun the failed job**: The first step is to rerun the failed Merge Batch ingestion job for IBank.\n* **Check the logs again**: After rerunning the job, check the logs again to ensure that the job has completed successfully.\n\nThe reason why it's done in patches is because of the large volume of data being processed. Processing all the data at once could lead to performance issues and potentially cause the job to fail again. By processing the data in smaller batches, or patches, the job can be completed more efficiently and with less risk of failure. \n\nNote: The above solution assumes that the failed job was due to a temporary issue and not due to a problem with the data itself. If the issue is with the data, then additional steps may be necessary to correct the issue before rerunning the job.",

Start `prodrestib` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib).\n\n2. Start `prodreston` Wildfly instances at both edge nodes of the other site using this [procedure](manage_wildfly.md#start-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n3. Ask for a mno Network administrator to make a call.\n   \n4. Ask them to enable the new servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to enable as explained [here](manage_wildfly.md#consolidated-network-information)).\n   \n5. Check logs for both Wildfly instances at both servers to ensure everything works.\n   \n6. When you are certain everything is OK, ask the mno Network administrators to disable the prexisting servers (mention the Loadbalancer IPs and the IP you want them to disable).\n   \n7. From the access logs of the prexisting Wildfly instances check that no traffic is received. \n   \n8. Stop these Wildfly instances as described in the procedures [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodrestib) and [here](manage_wildfly.md#stop-a-wildfly-instance-prodreston).\n\n### Migrate UC4 flows between PR/DR\n\n1.

The columns of the detail tables are produced either from a non json column of the input table (eg. client_username) or from parsing the json fields request_text_data and response_text_data and extracting specific fields based on their name. When two fields have the same name then we will keep the greater value either for a number field or for a string based on lexicographic order.\nThese jobs are executed by the bank's scheduler.

After replacing the disk, ensure that all necessary configurations are performed to integrate the new disk into the system.\n\n4. **Recommission the node through Cloudera Manager**: After successfully replacing the disk and completing all necessary configurations, recommission the node through Cloudera Manager to reintegrate it into the cluster.\n\n5. **Start the DataNode and verify its health**: Finally, start the DataNode that was previously stopped due to the failed disk replacement. Verify the health of the DataNode by checking for any errors or warnings in the logs and ensuring that it is properly communicating with the rest of the cluster.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively handle and recover from a failed disk replacement on a DataNode in HDFS, minimizing downtime and data loss.",
        "retrieved_context": "# InfiniBand Replacement\n\nReplacing an IB card require powering off the host. Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned.

Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary.

Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n\n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n\n## Pollaploi Flow\n\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**",

Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n\n## Hbase table creation\n\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n- Set throttle quotas of type 'read'\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'read'\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_read_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => WRITE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n-  Delete and recreate table to repeat to run tests with write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    n_splits = 300\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'write'\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_write_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/hbase2\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads\n\nhttps://blog.cloudera.com/hbase-performance-testing-using-ycsb/\n### Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\n\n1.

Check the new user and from the right bar click `delete this entry`\n\n\n# For Case 2 follow the below steps:\n\nIdentify which `kerb` ldap instance has the issue. For example check if they had the same ammount of `users` and `groups` with `ldapsearch` commands from checks\n\nFrom the `kerb` ldap instance without corruption :\n\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0  config.ldif\nslapcat -n 1 data.ldif\n\nscp *.ldif `ldap_instance_with_corruption`:/tmp\n```\nGo to corrupted `kerb` instance:\n\nBackup:\n```bash\ncp -rp /etc/openldap/ /tmp/openldap.bak\ncp -rp /var/lib/ldap/ /tmp\n```\n\nClear:\n```bash\nsystemctl stop slapd\nsystemctl status slapd\ncd /etc/openldap/\nrm \u2013Rf slapd.d\ncd /etc/openldap\nmkdir slapd.d\ncd /var/lib/ldap/\nrm \u2013Rf *\n```\nRestore:\n```bash\nslapadd -n 0 -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -l /tmp/config.ldif\nslapadd -n 2 -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -l /tmp/data.ldif -w\n```\nOwnership:\n```bash\nchown -R ldap:ldap /var/lib/ldap\n```\nStart `slapd` service:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start slapd\nsystemctl status slapd\n```\n\nChecks:\n\nCreate a new user on ldap kerb1 via `UI` with name `testuser`:\n\nThe procedure to create a new user described [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/openldap_change_manager_password.md)\n\nLogin into admin node as root:\n\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: (https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/)\n\nAfter succesfully creation of `testuser` check if exist on `kerb2` from the dropdown menu or via ldapsearch\n\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=testuser'\n```\n\nIf user exist then replication fixed. Just delete the `testuser`.\n\nThe procedure to delete a new user described [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/openldap_change_manager_password.md)\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\n\nServer:\n\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nUseful info:\n\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n\n### Update configuration\n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\n\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n\n3. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n# abc - [One Domain] SpagoBI integration with GROUPNET\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users.\n\nServer to use: PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nProd Server: un5.bigdata.abc.gr\nURL: https://cne.def.gr/SpagoBI\n999.999.999.999 cne.def.gr cne\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf it is not been imported, you should import them using formula  `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain so we can verify that the change is succesfully made. \nVaggos username in our case (enomikos)\n3. Customer should also send a bind user that we will use for groupnet domain configuration.\n4. `/etc/hosts` file at `un5` must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n5. Perfom an ldap search for the given bind user. \n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=enomikos)'\n```\n\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Backup spagobi mysql database:\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysqldump -u root -p spagobi --single-transaction > /tmp/spagobi.sql\n```\n\n2. Back up `ldap_authorizations.xml`:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# cp -ap /usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations.xml /usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations-central.xml\n```\n\n3. Back up haproxy:\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.bak\n```\n\n\n### Actions \n\n1. Login to `https://cne.def.gr/SpagoBI` with the credentials you have and create groupnet user for user `enomikos`:\n- User Management\n- Click on **Add**\n- Fill in with the user ID and full name\n- Add roles\n- Save\n\n2. Verify that the user is successfully created using following commands:\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u spagobi -p;\nmysql> use spagobi;\nmysql> show tables;\nmysql> select * FROM SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID='enomikos@groupnet';\n```\n\n3. Stop SpagoBI process:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# docker stop prod-spagobi-7.0.105\n```\n\n4. Edit the following lines at `un5:/usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations.xml`:\n\n```bash\n<!--  SERVER -->\n                <HOST>un1.bigdata.abc.gr</HOST>\n                <PORT>863</PORT>        \n                <ADMIN_USER>replace_with_name_of_admin</ADMIN_USER>\n                <ADMIN_PSW>replace_with_password</ADMIN_PSW> <!-- password in clear text -->\n                <BASE_DN>dc=groupnet,dc=gr</BASE_DN> <!-- base domain, if any -->\n```\n\n5. Update reverse proxy at `un1` so that Groupnet AD can be reached directly from spagobi app.\n\nAdd the following at `un1:/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`\n\n```bash\nlisten def-ad-ldaps\n    bind *:863 ssl crt /opt/security/haproxy/node.pem\n    mode tcp\n    balance     source\n    server def_ad1 PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636 ssl check ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\n```\n\n6. Test and reload haproxy in order changes to take effect\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -c\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl reload haproxy\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl status haproxy\n```\n\n7. Start SpagoBI app:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# docker start prod-spagobi-7.0.105\n```\n\n8. Check if `enomikos` can sign in. If yes, then go to the next step\n9. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\nmysql> use spagobi;\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%'; #check existing users that belong to central-domain\nUPDATE SBI_USER SET USER_ID = REPLACE(USER_ID,'@central-domain','@groupnet') WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%';\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%'; #check that no user left to central-domain\n```\n\n> Ndef: Before moving all users at once to the new domain you can first test just one. For example:\nUPDATE SBI_USER SET USER_ID = REPLACE(USER_ID,'@groupnet.gr','@groupnet') WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%enomikos@groupnet.gr%'\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%enomikos@groupnet.gr%'\n\n**Congrats!**\n# Manage IDM Replication\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Setup\n\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log",
