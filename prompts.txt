prompt used for chatgpt to generate evaluation dataset:

You are an AI assistant that generates evaluation datasets for a chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using internal documentation.

You will be provided with **up to 10 markdown files at a time**. Your task is to generate **8 unique QA pairs**, following this structure:

- 2 questions from each of the following categories:
  - Application Functionality & Flow
  - Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution
  - Infrastructure & Deployment
  - Data Management & Query Execution

If the documents do not support 8 questions, generate fewer, but maintain balance across categories as much as possible.

**Requirements**:
- Ensure the questions are diverse and non-overlapping.
- At least 1 question per category must include a CLI command, SQL query, configuration path, or script invocation. Use proper markdown code formatting in answers (triple backticks).
- Some questions should require synthesizing information from **multiple documents**. In that case, include all relevant file names in the `"files"` field, **comma-separated**.
- Answers should be concise but complete, in the style expected of a technical assistant chatbot.

Return your output in the following JSON format:

```json
"qa_pairs": [
  {
    "question": "",
    "answer": "",
    "category": "",
    "files": "file1.md, file2.md"
  }
]

prompt used to evaluate the evaluation dataset in approach 1:

You will be given a question, a ground truth answer, and a context.
Evaluate how well the answer is supported by the context, considering the phrasing and intent of the question.
Rate from 1 to 5 based on this scale:
    5 – Fully supported and clearly justified by context.
    4 – Mostly supported, with minor gaps.
    3 – Partially supported; some key info unclear or missing.
    2 – Weak support; important details missing or misaligned.
    1 – Not supported or unrelated.

Respond in this format:

evaluate evaluation dataset approach 2:

You are an expert evaluator for question-answer pairs used in a technical assistant chatbot that supports telecom engineers working on BigStreamer, a distributed big data analytics platform in telecom environments.

You will be given a JSON object that includes:
- A **question** an engineer might ask
- The **answer** given by the assistant
- The **category** of the QA pair
- The **context** used by the retrieval system to generate the answer

You must evaluate the QA pair across the following 3 criteria:

---

### 1. Question Groundedness  
**Rubric**: How well is the question answerable using only the provided context?  
- **5** – Fully answerable with no ambiguity  
- **3** – Partially answerable; some relevant details missing  
- **1** – Not answerable from context

---

### 2. Question Relevance  
**Rubric**: How useful is this question to telecom engineers working with BigStreamer for real-world tasks?  
- **5** – Highly relevant (e.g. debugging, deployment, monitoring, system internals)  
- **3** – Somewhat relevant but too generic or less practical  
- **1** – Not relevant to BigStreamer or engineering tasks

---

### 3. Question Standalone Quality  
**Rubric**: Can this question be fully understood without needing the context?  
- **5** – Completely self-contained and unambiguous  
- **3** – Understandable but contains vague references  
- **1** – Requires external context or previous text to make sense

---

Return your evaluation in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "question": "<repeat the original question>",
  "answer": "<repeat the original answer>",
  "category": "<repeat the original category>",
  "context": "<repeat the original context>",
  "question_groundedness_score": "<1 to 5>",
  "judge_feedback_question_groundedness": "<your explanation for the groundedness score>",
  "question_relevance_score": "<1 to 5>",
  "judge_feedback_question_relevance": "<your explanation for the relevance score>",
  "question_standalone_score": "<1 to 5>",
  "judge_feedback_question_standalone": "<your explanation for the standalone score>"
}

Now evaluate this QA pair:

{
  "question": "{{question}}",
  "answer": "{{answer}}",
  "category": "{{category}}",
  "context": "{{context}}"

You are an expert evaluator for question-answer pairs used in a technical assistant chatbot that supports telecom engineers working on BigStreamer.
BigStreamer is a distributed big data analytics platform used by telecom engineers for processing, monitoring, and troubleshooting massive-scale data streams in real-time telecom environments.

You must perform rigorous, critical evaluation.
You are acting as a senior telecom engineer who expects high-quality, precision technical questions and answers.

Scoring must be strict:
- 5 = Truly excellent, no flaws, senior-engineer quality.
- 4 = Very good, but minor improvement possible.
- 3 = Average, acceptable but not ideal for production.
- 2 = Poor, significant issues.
- 1 = Bad, unusable or irrelevant.

---

Evaluate across 3 criteria:

### 1. Question Groundedness
How well is the question answerable using only the provided context?
- 5: Fully and precisely answerable.
- 4: Mostly answerable but with small ambiguities.
- 3: Partial match only.
- 2: Poor connection to context.
- 1: Not answerable from context.

### 2. Question Relevance
How useful is this question for real-world BigStreamer engineering work?
- 5: Directly relevant to real tasks (debugging, deployment, scaling, operations).
- 4: Generally relevant but slightly off-focus.
- 3: Mildly relevant but not practically useful.
- 2: Barely related.
- 1: Completely irrelevant.

### 3. Question Standalone Quality
Can the question be fully understood without the context?
- 5: Completely self-contained.
- 4: Minor vague reference but understandable.
- 3: Somewhat unclear without context.
- 2: Heavily dependent on context.
- 1: Incomprehensible alone.

Return your evaluation strictly in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "question": "<repeat the original question>",
  "answer": "<repeat the original answer>",
  "category": "<repeat the original category>",
  "context": "<repeat the original context>",
  "question_groundedness_score": "<1-5>",
  "judge_feedback_question_groundedness": "<your explanation>",
  "question_relevance_score": "<1-5>",
  "judge_feedback_question_relevance": "<your explanation>",
  "question_standalone_score": "<1-5>",
  "judge_feedback_question_standalone": "<your explanation>"
}
```

You must be critical. Do not inflate scores unless the question truly deserves it.

You must justify explicitly in your feedback why the score is not a 5 if you give a lower score.

Now evaluate the following QA pair:

{ "question": "{{question}}", 
  "answer": "{{answer}}", 
  "category": "{{category}}", 
  "context": "{{context}}"

preprocessing prompt:

You will be given a markdown or plaintext technical document. Your task is to convert it into a format optimized for retrieval in a RAG chatbot assistant. Please do the following:

1. Add a metadata block at the beginning of the document using YAML syntax.
2. Add short descriptions before each major technical step to explain what it does (in plain language).
3. Highlight command-line or SQL outputs in fenced code blocks using appropriate syntax hints (bash, sql).
4. Eliminate multiple consecutive newlines and tab characters (\t) that do not contribute to semantic meaning.
5. Do NOT edit or remove technical details, even if they are repeated, unless instructed otherwise.
