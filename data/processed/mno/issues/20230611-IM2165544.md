# mno - BigStreamer - IM2165544 - Alert at Cloudera Manager (DR/PR)
## Description
Clock Offset alerts were triggered in Cloudera Manager across multiple edge nodes due to NTP time drift. The issue was traced to a domain controller outage and resolved by restarting the ntpd service.
The following alert appeared in Cloudera Manager (PR) in Hosts:
```
-pr1edge01.mno.g
-Clock Offset
```
Following ticket SD2228610, the following alerts also appeared in Hosts for Cloudera Manager DR and PR respectively:
```
-dr1edge02.mno.gr
-Clock Offset
```
```
-pr1edge02.mno.gr
-Clock Offset
```
## Actions Taken
1. Login to Cloudera Manager UI for both Sites
2. We did not notice any other issues on either Site after checking services' charts and did not have any other alerts
3. The clock offset relates to the ntpd service, so on the affected nodes (dr1edge02, pr1edge01, pr1edge02) we inspected the service's status:
```bash
systemctl status ntpd
```
The service was running.
4. We restarted the service on the affected nodes
```bash
systemctl restart ntpd
```
5. After a while the alert cleared up
6. We guessed that there were actions at the time servers
## Our Ticket Response
```
11/06/23 05:04:49 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):
We have restarted the ntpd service on dr1edge02, pr1edge01 and pr1edge02 that displayed the clock offset alert. After the restart, the alert cleared.
```
During communication with the customer it was confirmed that one of the two domain controllers was out due to patches.
