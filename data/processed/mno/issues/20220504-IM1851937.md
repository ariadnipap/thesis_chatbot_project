# mno - BigStreamer - IM1851937 - DWH_IBANK batch job failed
## Description
On 5/5/2022, the EXPORT batch job for the DWH_IBANK application failed in the Disaster Recovery (DR) site. The failure was detected through a Grafana alert and was attributed to conflicting executions: a manual run was triggered before the scheduled job had completed.
application: DWH_IBANK
job_name: EXPORT
component: SERVICE_AUDIT
description: Code 1
## Actions Taken
1. Login to grafana to make sure that the alert is about DR SITE
2. Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox
3. At the YARN UI search for `PRODUSER`, sort by End date and search with "PROD_IBANK_DWH_EXPORT_ServiceAudit. You will find the failed application.
4. From the UI we noticed that the job with id application_1651064786946_8294 started manually before the completion of the automated job with id application_1651064786946_8190, which led to the failure of the second job.
5. We informed the client that they should rerun the failed job manually from the scheduler after the completion of the manual step. Also, we pointed out that before proceding with manual actions they should make sure beforehand that all scheduled flows have completed.
A review of the application_ids on YARN revealed that application_1651064786946_8294 was launched manually before the completion of the automated scheduled job application_1651064786946_8190, resulting in a resource conflict and batch job failure.
We advised the client to avoid overlapping manual executions with scheduler runs to prevent such conflicts in the future.
