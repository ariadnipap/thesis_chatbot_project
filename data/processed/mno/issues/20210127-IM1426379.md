title: IBank HBase Batch Job Failure on DR Site Due to Oversized Row Key
description: The IBank_Migration job "Enrich HBase Visible Tables" failed due to a row key exceeding HBaseâ€™s 32,767-byte limit. A modified query with length filtering was used to rerun the job and successfully complete the HBase upsert.

  system: MNO BigStreamer - IBANK DR Site
  root_cause: HBase insert failure caused by row key exceeding 32,767-byte limit
  user_visible_error: "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Row length is > 32767"
  action_taken:
    - Investigated Grafana alert on failed job
    - Identified HBase key length violation in log output
    - Isolated faulty row with Impala query using `length(...) > 32767`
    - Duplicated and modified upsert script to filter out oversized keys
    - Re-executed job using the new script
  outcome: Job completed successfully after filtering invalid row; Grafana alert cleared

# mno - BigStreamer - IM1426379 - 2 Batch Job failed on dr1edge01.mno.gr
## Description
The IBank_Migration batch job failed on the Disaster Recovery site (`dr1edge01.mno.gr`) during the `Enrich HBase Visible Tables` stage due to an HBase row key exceeding the 32,767-byte limit. This triggered an `IllegalArgumentException` and caused the upsert to terminate abnormally. The issue was resolved by filtering out the violating row and rerunning the job with a modified script.
## Actions Taken
1. Login to Grafana `https://dr1edge02.mno.gr:3000` with personal account
2. Inspected `LOCAL MONITORING`/`I-Bank Batch Jobs Overview` 
3. From the diagram stage `Enrich HBase Visible Tables` had failed
4. According to [Hadoop Trac](http://999.999.999.999/trac/hadoop/wiki/dev/project/mno/support), execution is done with the following command:
```bash
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`  >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log 2>&1
```
5. Connected  on MobaXterm via ssh to `dr1edge01` and changed user to `PRODREST` using sudo.
7. Check the logs of failed script.Look for IllegalArgumentException in logs. 
```bash
less /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log
...
WARNING: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Row length 34XXX is > 32767
```
8. After investigation this error indicates that the key column for the HBase table is greater than the limit, so the insert fails.
9. Find how many lines are causing this error by executing the `SELECT` part of the query and adding `WHERE length(...)>32767` at the end:
```sql
SELECT
        concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id),
        'true',
        'true',
        originate_timestamp,
        ...
ON a.service_name = b.name
WHERE b.show_customer=TRUE
       AND length(concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id))>32767;
```
This query returned 1 row. Copy the above query into a file for future reference.
10. Copy script `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`.
11. Edit the copy. Append `AND length(concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id))<32767` at the end of the query.
11. Execute the new script. Check the execution is successful.
```bash
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh.pqr `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`  >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log 2>&1
```
12. In the Grafana charts, check that stage is green now.
