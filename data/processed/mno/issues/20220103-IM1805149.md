    - Manually executed job in three parts using known script
    - Updated Postgres monitoring database to mark job as successful
    - Used support flow documentation to resume job from the proper pipeline stage

# mno - BigStreamer - IM1805149 - IBank_Ingetion batch job failed
## Description
On 1/3/2022, the IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch Spark job failed due to an Out Of Memory error. The job was re-executed in three intervals to work around memory constraints. Postgres monitoring tables were manually updated to show job success, and the pipeline was resumed from the appropriate downstream step using a modified master script.
job_name: MergeBatch
component: Job
Status: Failed
Host: dr1edge01.mno.gr
## Actions Taken
1. Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox
2. At the YARN UI search for `PRODREST` and sort by End date. You will find the failed application.
3. From the UI we saw that Spark exited due to OOM errors.
4. Using this [document](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch) we executed Merge Batch in 3 steps in parallel:
```bash
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh "2022-02-28 00:00:00" "2022-02-28 12:00:00"
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh "2022-02-28 12:00:00" "2022-02-28 18:00:00"
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh "2022-02-28 18:00:00" "2022-01-03 00:00:00"
```
5. We updated the monitoring postgres database in order for the entry to appear green in Grafana. You can get a success query for Merge batch from the log file of the master script and change the dates. To confirm resolution, verify that Grafana shows no failed MergeBatch jobs for 2022-02-28.
6. We created a copy of the master script as `PRODREST` at `dr1edge01`.
7. nside the copied script, we removed the pre-processing steps before the [Distinct join to Service Audit](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#distinct-join-to-service-audit) stage.
8. We executed the copy script and performed checks as ndefd in the support document.
