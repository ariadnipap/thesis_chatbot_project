# mno - BigStreamer - IM2072206 - Batch Job Failed
## Description
On 27/01/2023, the `EXTRACT` batch job for the `MY BANK` component of the `DWH_IBank` application failed with **Code 6** in Grafana.
```
Application: DWH_IBank
Job Name: EXTRACT
Component: MY BANK
Status: Failed
Description: Code 6
```
## Root Cause Analysis
1. Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account and confirm that Datawarehouse Flow failed from `Monitoring/Monitoring PR/DR` dashboard.
The flow failed with `Code: 6` which means that the control script has timed-out while monitoring the `EXTRACT` script.
2. Check logs:
From `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:
``` bash
less /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log
```
![IM2072206_extract_logs](.media/IM2072206_extract_logs.png)
The monitoring database was updated with status FAILED due to `Check if app is running` timeout.
3. Check the Spark application status from YARN UI
![IM2072206_yarn_app](.media/IM2072206_yarn_app.png)
Spark App Status: SUCCEEDED.
The script waited for only 1,5min and updated the monitoring database with Failed Status. Spark app began its execution after almost 2,5 minutes.
> 2,5min is not considered as a noticeable or abnormal delay time, so we did not investigate further.
4. Customer reran the job
5. Check logs and YARN UI of second application
![IM2072206_yarn_rerun](.media/IM2072206_yarn_rerun.png)
![IM2072206_rerun_logs](.media/IM2072206_rerun_logs.png)
In this case the Spark app started immediately and the script updated the monitoring app with Running Status.
