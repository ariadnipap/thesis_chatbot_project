# mno - BigStreamer - IM1317401 - [PR][IBANK] Query Average Response Time alert
## Description
Alert message on Grafana:
[PR][IBANK] Query Average Response Time alert
## Actions Taken
1. Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account
2. Inspected `[PR][IBANK] Query Average Response Time alert` graph
```
I edited the graph temporarily to display the max response time instead of the mean value. Usually the problem affects 3-4 queries and is due to user actions in the PR site.
These problematic queries add bias to the mean time and create the alarm. By checking the max values, I saw that that was the case.
```
3. Login to pr1edge01.mno.gr/pr1edge02.mno.gr with personal account and check access logs under `/var/log/wildfly/prodrestib/access.log`
4. Login to Primary Site Cloudera Manager `https://pr1edge01.mno.mno.gr:7183` and check that the cluster is in healthy status
5. No action taken. The alarm will clear without the need for manual action.
6. Since no actions had been initiated from our team on the PR site at the time of the incident, we requested that MNO verify whether internal user activity may have caused the query load.
