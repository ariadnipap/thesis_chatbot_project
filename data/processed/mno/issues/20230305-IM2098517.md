# mno - BigStreamer - IM2098517 - Health issue on dr1edge01
## Description
On 07/03/2023, Cloudera Manager reported an unexpected exit for the Spark on YARN History Server running on `dr1node03` in the Disaster Recovery (DR) site. The crash was caused by an `OutOfMemoryError`, due to the default Java heap size being set too low (512MB).
The following health issue has occurred in the cloudera manager system:
```
Spark on yarn - History Server (dr1node03) - Unexpected Exits
```
## Actions Taken
### Investigation
1. Login to Cloudera for DR Site
2. We inspected logs for this role for the time that the problem arose: `Cloudera > Diagnostics > Logs` and chose `Service: Spark on Yarn` and `Role: History Server`. We could not identify the root cause by these logs
3. ssh to dr1node03 as root, went to `/var/run/process` , and inspected logs from the process that ran at the time of the problem and found out that the process with pid 51291 was killed while a `OutOfMemoryError` occured

### Resolution
4. We checked the  `java heap size` of the History Server through Cloudera UI configuration tab. It was set to 512M.
5. We checked the respective option for the PR Site and it was set to 2G
6. We set the `java heap size` of the History Server to 2G at the DR Site
7. We proceeded to restart of the role after communication with the customer
## Our Ticket Response
```

We have restarted the History Server after a phone call. There was no problem during the restart.
Thank you
07/03/23 16:21:21 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):
The exit occurred due to an out of memory error. We have changed the java heap size of the History Server from 512MB to 2GB as in the PR. We will need to restart the role. There will be no outage.
