title: TimeDeposit Extraction Job Blocked Due to Incomplete Monitoring Status Entry
description: The `sched_extract_details.sh -t timeDeposit` script failed due to a previously incomplete job status entry in `dwh_monitoring` caused by Hive metastore downtime during an upsert; resolved by manually correcting the status in Impala.

# mno - BigStreamer - SD2048346 - error in PROD_SUBMIT SH TIMEDEPOSIT sh script
## Description
The `sched_extract_details.sh -t timeDeposit` job failed during execution. The script crashed with error: ERROR DESCRIPTION=ANOTHER_PROCESS_RUNNING
This was due to a previously incomplete status entry for the same job in the `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_monitoring` table. During the previous execution, an `UPSERT` that should have marked the job status as `SUCCESS` failed because the Hive Metastore was unavailable (see SD2046350). As a result, the job status remained `RUNNING`, preventing subsequent executions.
## Actions Taken
1. Login to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account and then `sudo su - PRODUSER`
2. We tried to re-run the script using the following command:
```bash
/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t timeDeposit
```
But we got the following error:
**ERROR DESCRIPTION=ANOTHER_PROCESS_RUNNING**
3. After investigation at impala queries and alert notification we realized that at `10/04/2022 8:29 AM` which was the time that the `extract` of `time_deposit` was running, the upsert that updates the status (SUCCEDED/RUNINNG/FAILED) of the job, failed due to hive metastore unavailability at that time. 
> Ndef: Hive metastore issue is discribed at **SD2046350**
## Root Cause Analysis
We found that with below steps:
- From DR CM UI -> Impala -> Queries 
- In searh bar type: `statement rlike 'upsert into prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.*'` and click on `Search` to find the query
Login to dr1edge01 with your personal account and then `sudo su - PRODUSER`
Investigate impala tables with below commands:
```bash
impala-shell -k -i dr1edge01.mno.gr --ssl
SHOW CREATE TABLE prod_trlog_bank_analytical.dwh_monitoring;
SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_bank_analytical.dwh_monitoring WHERE details_type='TIME_DEPOSIT' and
'procedure'='EXTRACT' and par_dt > 20221002;
```
Therefore, at `10/05/2022` when the script executed again, the job crashed due to the fact that the value on the impala table was set to RUNNING. 
We had to manually change he value of yesterday's job to `SUCCESS` using the following impala query.
First, login to dr1edge01 with your presonal account, change to PRODUSER with `sudo su - PRODUSER` and login to impala-shell using following command:
```bash
impala-shell -k -i dr1edge01.mno.gr --ssl
```
In our case we run the following query:
```bash
UPSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_monitoring
(details_type, procedure_par_dt,status.start_time,end_time,description) VALUES
('TIME DEPOSIT','EXTRACT','20221003','SUCCESS','2022-10-04','08:32-42.000','2022-10-04','08-39:21.000',")
```
> Ndef: In case you want to run the above query for a different job modify VALUES according the procedure_par_dt, details_type, etc
4. Repeat **step 2** in order script to succeed or ask mno to do that.
