# mno - BigStreamer - IM1769421 - User Cannot Execute Queries in Hue or Impala
## Description
User E70529 was unable to execute queries via Hue or impala-shell despite having the correct permissions. The issue started after a group mapping problem occurredâ€”no group was shown for the user's GID in Hue, and attempting to manually create and sync the group in Hue's user management interface resulted in a crash.
## Actions Taken
1. Login to dr1node3 as root and check the groups of E70529 user:
`# id E70529 | grep 871556062`
You will notice that the name of the above group is empty.
Lets fix that!
Ndef1: This occurs for dr1node03, dr1node05, dr1node06, dr1node07,dr1node08,dr1node09,dr1node10
Ndef2: Perform the above actions for all nodes
2. `# sss_cache -E;id E70529 | grep 871556062`
Now you must be able to see the name of the group. If not, continue with the following steps in order to clear cache and restart sssd with the right name of the group:
1.  `# dcli -c dr1node03, dr1node05, dr1node06, dr1node07,dr1node08,dr1node09.dr1node10  'mv /var/lib/sss/db/* /tmp;systemctl restart sssd'`
2.  `# dcli -C 'id E70529 | grep -v "CMS Way4Manager PROD RDS DevTOOLS"'`
3.  `# dcli -C 'id E70529 | grep -v "CMS Way4Manager PROD RDS DevTOOLS"' | wc -l`
