  issue_id: IM1332456
  system: MNO BigStreamer IBANK DR Site
  root_cause: Partition data was missing because the table had not been refreshed before running the Spark flow, even though the monitoring table reported success
  user_visible_symptom: Latest partition in `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical` was 20201023 instead of 20201025
  flow_status: SUCCESS in monitoring dashboard
  action_taken:
    - Verified Spark topology health
    - Checked partitions in Impala
    - Validated job status in Grafana (LOCAL MONITOR/Batch Jobs DR)
    - Coordinated with customer to refresh the table before job execution
  outcome: Table was refreshed and issue resolved

## Description
A discrepancy was found in the `prod_trlog_ibank_analytical` database on the DR site: the last available partition was `20201023`, while it should have included `20201025`. Despite this, the weekend extraction flows appeared as `SUCCESS` in the Grafana monitoring table, leading to confusion about actual data completeness.
## Actions Taken
1. Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account
2. Inspected `LOCAL MONITOR/Batch Jobs DR`
3. DW JOBS `Check that all is SUCCESS`
4. Open an SSH session to `dr1edge01.mno.gr` using your personal account.
5. Connect to Impala:
```bash
impala-shell -i dr1edge.mno.gr -k --ssl
```
6. Execute the query `select count(*),par_dt from service_audit where par_dt > 20200919 group by 2 order by 2;`
7. Check that par_dt has inserted data
8. After the above checking procedure, customer informed to refresh the above table before execute a spark/flow and that the spark topology was healthy.
