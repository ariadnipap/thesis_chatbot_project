# mno - BigStreamer - IM1840323 - Issue with query details CMert
## Description
In some queries we cannot see the details from cloudera manager > impala > queries while they are in the executing phase.
Example
https://pr1node03.mno.gr:7183/cmf/impala/queryDetails?queryId=e7441b27715b1699%3Ad3527df300000000&serviceName=impala
## Actions Taken
1. Check that that the problem truly occurs:
- Login to CM DR with your pesonal account and go to `Cloudera Manager > impala > queries`
- Select a query that it on executing phase and click on `Query details`
When accessing Impala query details during execution, the interface displayed only ‘Waiting on Client’ with no detail view.
2. As a part of the investigation we created `SR 3-29589386011`
3. According to Oracle’s response, the issue was caused by session and query timeouts in Impala and Hue. So we had to set the below values: 
- Login to CM DR with your pesonal account and go to `Cloudera Manager > Hue >  Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.in` and set the below values: 
```bash
[impala]
query_timeout_s=60
session_timeout_s=60
close_queries =true
[desktop]
[[auth]]
idle_session_timeout=300
```
4. `Restart` Hue Service
5. From `Cloudera Manager > Impala > Configuration and change below values:
- idle_query_timeout: 1 min
- idle_session_timeout: 1 min
6. `Restart` Impala Service
