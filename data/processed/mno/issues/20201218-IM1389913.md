title: Disaster Site IBANK - Incorrect Historical Data in service_audit_stream and PR to DR Partition Sync
description: Historical data inconsistencies found in DR table prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream were resolved by transferring correct partitions from PR to DR using temporary tables and Cloudera Replication. The issue was initially caused by a past Kudu malfunction at DR site.

context:
  issue_id: IM1389913
  system: MNO BigStreamer - IBANK DR Site
  root_cause: Kudu malfunction caused old data to be inserted in `service_audit_stream` at DR. PR had correct values.
  action_taken:
    - Verified partition counts across PR and DR using impala-shell
    - Created and populated temporary table in PR with correct partitions
    - Synchronized data to DR using Cloudera Replication Manager
    - Dropped incorrect partitions from DR
    - Re-inserted correct data from temp table into DR `service_audit`
    - Validated data parity post-restore
  outcome: All target partitions in DR now match PR site; corrupted historical data was successfully replaced

# mno - BigStreamer - IM1389913 - Disaster Site IBANK - Incorrect Historical Data in service_audit_stream and PR to DR Partition Sync
## Description
Discrepancies were identified in the `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream` table at the Disaster Recovery site, where older historical records had incorrectly reappeared. The issue did not affect the Primary site, confirming the corruption was isolated to DR, most likely due to Kudu service instability in the past. A full validation and restoration from PR to DR was carried out via Impala and Replication Manager.

## Actions Taken
1. Initial investigation by lmn team indicated the root cause was DR-local Kudu issues. PR data was intact.
```
The problem you are reporting only appears on the Disaster Site. It is related to the problems that the Kudu service was experiencing at that time.
From the comparison of data with the Primary Site we see that the data has been passed correctly to service_audit.
Please confirm that you have the same picture of the problem and if we can proceed to delete the data from the service_audit_stream.
```
Customer then wanted to transfer data from PR to DR.
5. Connected  on MobaXterm via ssh to `dr1edge01` and changed user to `PRODREST` using sudo.
7. Open `impala-shell` for DR site and check row count of `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`  for these specific dates.
```bash
impala-shell -i dr1edge.mno,gr -k --ssl
select par_dt, count(*)  from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit where par_dt in (20201105, 20201111, 20201120, 20201127, 20201202) group by 1 order by 1;
par_dt count
20201105 20189258
20201111 18855105
20201120 20212408
20201127 36624142
20201202 25042327
```
Execute the same query for PR site by opening the `impala-shell` for PR, to compare row counts.
```
impala-shell -i pr1edge.mno,gr -k --ssl
```
8. Create temporary table at PR and insert the partitions we want to transfer to DR
```
impala-shell -i pr1edge.mno,gr -k --ssl
...
CREATE TABLE prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp LIKE prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit;
set MAX_ROW_SIZE=100mb;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit WHERE par_dt = 20201105;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit WHERE par_dt = 20201111;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit WHERE par_dt = 20201120;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit WHERE par_dt = 20201127;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit WHERE par_dt = 20201202;
```
8. Create an empty temporary table at DR.
```
impala-shell -i pr1edge.mno,gr -k --ssl
...
CREATE TABLE prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp LIKE prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit;
```
9. Open Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:7183` at DR and login with your `EXXXXX` account.
10. Go to `Backup`>`Replication Schedules` from the top bar.
11. Edit configuration of `one_off_replication` and change `Databases` field to point to the new temporary table at DR `Databases | prod_trlog_ibank | service_audit_temp `
10. From `Actions` of `one_off_replication` execute `Dry Run`. Check logs of the execution. Sometimes there is an `Connection timed out` error. If that's the case, click on `Abort` and execute `Dry Run` once again.
11. After `Dry Run` has finished, under `one_off_replication` there will be information on the number of databases, tables and partitions that are going to be transferred. In this case we had 1 database, 1 table and 400 partitions (each day has 40 subpartitions and we had 5 dates).
11. From actions of `one_off_replication` click on `Run Now`.
11. After it finishes, check that all rows have been transferred correctly. Open `impala-shell` for DR site and check row count of `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp`  for these specific dates.
```
impala-shell -i dr1edge.mno,gr -k --ssl
INVALIDATE METADATA prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp;
select par_dt, count(*)  from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp where par_dt in (20201105, 20201111, 20201120, 20201127, 20201202) group by 1 order by 1;
par_dt count
20201105 20189258
20201111 18855105
20201120 20212408
20201127 36624142
20201202 25042327
```
12. Delete problematic partitions of `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit` at DR.
```
impala-shell -i dr1edge.mno,gr -k --ssl
...
ALTER TABLE prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit DROP PARTITION (PAR_DT IN (20201105, 20201111, 20201120, 20201127, 20201202));
```
14. Insert data from temporary table.
```
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp WHERE par_dt = 20201105;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp WHERE par_dt = 20201111;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp WHERE par_dt = 20201120;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp WHERE par_dt = 20201127;
INSERT INTO prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit PARTITION (par_dt, par_clun) SELECT * FROM prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_temp WHERE par_dt = 20201202;
```
7. Open `impala-shell` for DR site and validate that row count of `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit`  is the same as seen in PR.
```
impala-shell -i dr1edge.mno,gr -k --ssl
select par_dt, count(*)  from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit where par_dt in (20201105, 20201111, 20201120, 20201127, 20201202) group by 1 order by 1;
par_dt count
20201105 ...
20201111 ...
20201120 ...
20201127 ...
20201202 ...
```
