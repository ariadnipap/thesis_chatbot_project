description: The IBank MergeBatch job failed in the DR cluster due to memory exhaustion during Spark execution; resolved by increasing coalesce value and rerunning all batch sub-steps manually.

context:
  issue_id: SD2146915-IM2085092
  system: mno BigStreamer DR Site
  root_cause: Spark memory limit exceeded during MergeBatch execution in DR, likely caused by heavy service_audit dataset load
  resolution_summary: Increased coalesce value from 6 to 12, reran distinct join and all batch sub-steps manually; job succeeded afterward
  impacted_component: IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch
  corrective_actions:
    - log review
    - coalesce tuning
    - manual execution of historical and reporting scripts
    - graphite report resubmission
    - duplicate check in Kudu/HBase

# mno - BigStreamer - SD2146915-IM2085092 [DR][IBANK] Application : IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch Failed
## Description
We have the following alert msg on Grafana.
```
[DR][IBANK] IBank_Ingestion MergeBatch Failed
```
## Actions Taken
1. Login to `dr1edge01` with your account
```bash
su - PRODREST
```
2. We check the script log:
Script Logs: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log`
Error code: `Log messages was for memory fault.`
We also look at the Spark logs:
Use Firefox on dr1edge01.mno.gr/pr1edge01.mno.gr to access the logs via YARN Resource Manager UI
Script: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/cronExecutor_MergeBatchWithLock_hdfs_STABLE.sh` on dr1edge01.mno.gr/pr1edge01.mno.gr (each   edge server submits to a different cluster)
### Troubleshooting
- Use the script logs `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/cronExecutor_ibankBatch_full.log` to identify the cause of the failure
If we have mentioned `error code` then:
```bash
vi /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh
```
Change `colaesce` from `6` to `12` and save changes. 
> Ndef: Inform the next day developers in order to update the git repo with the new value
- Ensure that no records are present in prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old
``` bash
# eg. 09-11-2019
impala-shell -k --ssl -i ${HOSTNAME/01/} -q "select  count(*) from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit where par_dt='20191109';"
```
- If no records exist and no other process is up, you can run the script again.
- For the previous day:
``` bash
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_service_audit_insert_join_distinct.sh `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'` >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_service_audit_insert_join_distinct.log 2>&1
```
- For a specified date:
``` bash
# e.g. 09-11-2019
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_service_audit_insert_join_distinct.sh 20191109 >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_service_audit_insert_join_distinct.log 2>&1
```
The process runs for well over an hour under normal circumstances or even longer for heavy load. Use of screen command advised.
After the above script completed we ran the next sub-steps manually:
1. `Distinct join to Service Audit` from [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#distinct-join-to-service-audit)
2.  `Report stats to Graphite` from [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#report-stats-to-graphite)
3. `Drop hourly partitions` from [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#drop-hourly-partitions)
4. `Upsert to HBase (Migration)` from [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#upsert-to-hbase-migration)
5. `Send reports to business users` from [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#send-reports-to-business-users)
6. `Duplicates between Impala and Kudu/HBase` from [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#duplicates-between-impala-and-kuduhbase)
## Root Cause
The MergeBatch job on the DR site failed due to Spark memory exhaustion while processing `prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_old`. Logs confirmed a memory fault error, and coalesce was initially set too low for the workload.
