## Description
Navigator analytics tab was not displaying data on the primary site due to metadata server issues. Logs revealed schema inconsistency errors related to invalid columns. Issue resolved by purging the metadata storage directory and resetting the NAV_UPGRADE_ORDINAL table in the Navigator DB.
## Actions Taken
1. Login to Cloudera Navigator on PR Site (https://xxxx:7187) with your Exxx account
2. Check analytics tab if you have permissions to see the graphs (If you are in WBDADMIN group you should see)
3. ssh Exxx@pr1edge01;ssh Exxx@pr1node03;
4. less /var/log/cloudera-scm-navigator/ & check navigator logs for errors
5. Errors for invalid columns appeared.
6. To solve the issue we made the below steps:
Purging the Navigator Metadata Server Storage Directory
- Identify and take ndef of the Navigator Metadata Server Storage Dir directory by Logging into Cloudera Manager and browsing to Cloudera Management Services > Configuration > Navigator Metadata Server > Navigator Metadata Server Storage Dir. Ndef the storage directory location.
- Stop Navigator Metadata Server by navigating to Cloudera Management Service > Instances, selecting Navigator Metadata Server > Actions > Stop # First Infrom Monitoring and after stop the role.
- Backup the storage Directory. Example:
```bash
# sudo tar -cpzf /<backup-location/navms_data_backup-`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M`.gz /<Navigator Metadata Server Storage Dir location>
```
- Remove the Navigator Metadata Server Storage Dir location. Example:
```bash
# sudo mv /<Navigator Metadata Server Storage Dir location>/ /root/<Navigator Metadata Server Storage Dir location>_bkp
```
- Starting 2.9 release whenever NMS Solr data directory is purged, database table need to be modified to make sure that state is in sync. To do this run following SQL command in NMS database:
```bash
ssh pr1edge01;
ssh pr1node03;
mysql -uroot -p
use navigator_metadata;
# Required for NMS >=2.9 to sync schema state after purge
create table date_temp_nav_upgrade_ordinal as select * from NAV_UPGRADE_ORDINAL;
delete from NAV_UPGRADE_ORDINAL;
insert into NAV_UPGRADE_ORDINAL values(-1, -1);
```
- Start Navigator Metadata Server and it will recreate data directory and Solr schema on the first run. Cloudera Management Service > Instances, selecting Navigator Metadata Server > Actions > Start
7. Reproduce steps 1 & 2 to check if issue solved.
8. Infrom Monitoring that all tasks completed.
