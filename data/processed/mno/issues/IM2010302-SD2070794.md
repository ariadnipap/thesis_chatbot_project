# mno - BigStreamer - SD2070794 - Alert at Cloudera Manager on DR
## Description
Service affected: Hosts
Bad Health issue for dr1edge01.mno.gr (Agent Status)
## Actions Taken
1. Logged in to Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:7183` with personal account in order to check the status of the host "dr1edge01.mno.gr".
2. Checked `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:7183/cmf/hardware/hosts` the host.
3. Continued in Cloudera Manager on host "dr1edge01.mno.gr" and checked the disks.
4. Logged in to "dr1edge01.mno.gr" node with personal account.
5. Executed the following command and disk usage check performed on the nodes.
```bash
df -h
```
6. We saw that the usage in "/var" partition was 100%.
7. We proceed to find wich directory has big enough size.
```bash
sudo du -sh /var/*
```
As we noticed "/var/lib/carbon" directory was enormous, up to 199 G. This directory concerns **Graphite** application. <br/>
8. We navigated to /var/lib/carbon/whisper/translog-api/spark
```bash
cd /var/lib/carbon/whisper/translog-api/spark
```
In this directory we can delete without any confirmation all the "DEV" directories.
```bash
-bash-4.2$ sudo rm -rf IBank_IngestStream_DEV_mno IBank_MergeBatch_DEV_mno IBank_MergeBatch_DEV_mno_Hourly Online_IngestStream_DEV_mno Online_MergeBatch_DEV_mno Online_MergeBatch_DEV_mno_Hourly
```
9. Disk usage has been checked again as step [5](#step-5).
10. Cloudera Manager has been checked to validate that the bad status host alert has been eliminated as step [1](#step-1).
## Root Cause
The `/var` partition on dr1edge01 was full due to accumulated Graphite metrics data from DEV topologies under `/var/lib/carbon/whisper/translog-api/spark`, causing agent heartbeat failures.
