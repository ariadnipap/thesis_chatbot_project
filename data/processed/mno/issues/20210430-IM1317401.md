title: IBANK MergeBatch Failure on DR Site Due to Memory Exhaustion - Manual Recovery
description: The IBANK_Migration MergeBatch job failed on 2021-04-30 due to excessive data volume and memory exhaustion. The Spark job was reconfigured with increased coalesce and shuffle partitions, and rerun from the merge section of the ingestion script to complete the Data Warehouse pipeline.

  root_cause: Spark MergeBatch job failed due to memory issues caused by large data volume; default configuration insufficient
  user_visible_error: Job failed in Yarn and did not appear in active applications list
  action_taken:
    - Inspected job status in Grafana
    - Verified failure in `monitor_sched_jobs` and via `yarn`
    - Increased `coalesce` and `shuffle.partitions` values in Spark submit script
    - Restarted ingestion script from merge section
  outcome: MergeBatch job completed successfully after reconfiguration

## Description
The IBank_Migration job pipeline appeared successful for all historical stages on `20210429`, except for the `MergeBatch` job, which failed. This job is critical for aggregating and inserting the final data into the Data Warehouse. Investigation showed that it crashed due to memory issues when processing large data volumes, and a reconfiguration of the Spark parameters was required to complete execution.
Data Warehouse jobs have not run:
```sql
select * from prod_trlog_ibank.monitor_sched_jobs where par_dt=20210429

## Actions Taken
1. Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account
2. Inspected `[PR][IBANK] Overview` graph
3. Merge Batch job has FAILED
4. MergeBatch job was not running : `yarn application -list | grep -i merge | grep -v Hourly`
5. Found Spark job failure due to OOM (Out Of Memory) error in Yarn logs.
6. Failure was reproducible; retry without changes failed again.
7. `Vi /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh`
8. Search for “coalesce” , Change/replace `-coalesce=$NUMBER_OF_EXECUTORS \ ` , To : `-coalesce=96 \ `
9. Search for `--spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=16  \`  to : `--spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=96  \`
10. As user PRODREST, rerun ingestion script from merge step: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/historical/ibank_histMigrate_aggr_MergeBatchWithLock_STABLE_v2.sh`
