# abc - IM1962926 - RStudio Connect User App Failure (kmpoletis)
## Description
RStudio user applications not working.
The applications of the user kmpoletis are not running showing the following error. This morning we reset the user's password because it had expired. It can connect normally with the credentials. Also let me know that the applications of the other users (Charisis, Ploskas) are running normally.
## Actions Taken
### 1. Validate LDAP Bind Account (t1-svc-cnebind)
- Ssh to **unrstudio1**
- Do an ldap search using `t1-svc-cnebind` as the following in order to check if `t1-svc-cnebind` password is still valid:
```bash
ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D "t1-svc-cnebind" -W -b "dc=groupnet,dc=gr" '(sAMAccountName=t1-svc-cnebind)'
```
-  In the above case, if you get an error that you can't connect with the ldap server, that means it has an expired `t1-svc-cnebind` password, so you will need to replace it with a new one.
### 2. Update LDAP Bind Password in RStudio Connect Config
- Check the configuration file below for the current ldap t1-svc-cnebind password & replace it with new **(Responsible for that abc Admin)**:
```bash
ssh unrstudio1
vi /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg
```
### Conclusion
RStudio Connect applications for user `kmpoletis` failed due to expired `t1-svc-cnebind` LDAP credentials. Issue resolved by updating the bind password in the system configuration file. Other users remained unaffected.
