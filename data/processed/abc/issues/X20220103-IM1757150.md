description: Root cause analysis and recovery actions for missing partitions in the `brond.brond_retrains_hist` table for 2023-01-01 to 2023-01-03 due to incorrect SFTP file naming. Includes query verification, log review, ingestion logic from `brond_retrains.pl`, and communication with upstream data providers.

# abc - SD1811952 (brond.brond_retrains_hist missing data)
## Description
Load brond.brond_retrains_hist table for 01/01, 02/01 and 03/01
### Flow Information
0. Flow info:
```
runs every day via crontab at 08:00: 
un2:/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/brond_retrains.pl
as intra 
Connects to sftp 172.16.166.30
takes parameters from :
/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/transferlist/brond_retrains.trn
/shared/abc/brond/bin/000_brond_retrains_ops.sh runs after /shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/brond_retrains.pl
LOGs: 
- /shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/log/brond_rollout_cron.* for /shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/brond_retrains.pl
- /shared/abc/brond/log/000_brond_retrains_ops.* for /shared/abc/brond/bin/000_brond_retrains_ops.sh
```
## Actions Taken
### 1. Check for Missing Partitions in Impala
1. Verify that there are no data for the corresponding par_dts (Impala shell) by choosing a convenient date:
```sql
select count(*), par_dt from brond.brond_retrains_hist where par_dt >= '20221231' group by 2 order by 2;
```
No data was found for 1/1, 2/1, and 3/1.
### 2. Review Ingestion Logs and Filename Format Issue
2. By checking the **/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/log/brond_rollout_cron** log file, it was found out that the corresponding par_dts could not be created in Hive because their names, e.g. 20220101, could not be deduced. The brond_retrains.pl script deduces the name of the par_dt it will create by examining the name of the uploaded files on the SFTP server. The names of the uploaded files must have the following format:
Counter_Collection_24H.<number>_<yyyy>_<mm>_<dd>.csv
However, that was not the case for the files corresponding to those days.
### 3. Communication with abc for Correct File Reupload
3. We asked abc to re-upload the files with correct names.
