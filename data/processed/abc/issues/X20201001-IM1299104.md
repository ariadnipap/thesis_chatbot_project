# Missing Logs from abc Syslog (un2)
## Description
The abc syslog administrators reported that server `172.25.37.236` showed significantly lower and irregular log reception from July 23 to July 27. This procedure outlines the steps taken to investigate and identify potential causes for the missing logs.
## Actions Taken
1. SSH into the `un2` node as `root`:

```

```
- Verify if logs were rotated or deleted.
