title: SM Metrics Missing in PE_BRNCH_QoS for Piraeus â€“ numofrtt Zero
description: Analysis of missing metrics for Piraeus entries in the `PE_BRNCH_QoS` output file on 2022-02-15 15:20. Explains that blank fields occur when the `numofrtt` field is zero in the SLA computation script, which prevents metrics like `rttd` from being calculated and populated in the file.

# abc - BigStreamer - IM1793457 - SM - Missing Data 14022022
## Description
Alarm in the SM system. There seems to be missing metrics for Piraeus in the PE_BRNCH_QoS file.
### Customer Update
As an example, here are 2 cases below.
```
PE_BRANCH_QoS received by SM for 5min 15:20 seems to be missing metrics in each QoS
PB-2084-ce.piraeusbank.customers.fghnet.gr
SM-MISSING DATA 14022022_1.png
PB-2600-ce.piraeusbank.customers.fghnet.gr
SM-MISSING DATA 14022022_2.png
```
Accordingly in the file received by SM for 5 minutes 00:20 there were measurements: 
SM-MISSING DATA 14022022_3.png
## Actions Taken
### 1. Validate Output File Contents
1. Check the metrics in the output file:
```bash
[root@un2]# less /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/custompoller/PE_BRNCH_QoS_2022-02-15_15.20.00.csv | grep "piraeusbank.customers.fghnet.gr||"
[root@un2]# less /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/custompoller/PE_BRNCH_QoS_2022-02-15_15.20.00.csv | grep "PB-2600-ce.piraeusbank.customers.fghnet.gr"
```
### 2. Check Source Data in Hive Tables
2. Input files are loaded into Hive table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist\
Check the metrics for several files and compare them:
```bash
#From Hue
select * from bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist where n5_minute='2022-02-15 00:20:00' and site_code='PB-2600';
select * from bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist where n5_minute='2022-02-15 15:20:00' and site_code='PB-2600';
```
### 3. Understand CSV Metric Format
3. The format of the PE_BRNCH_QoS_<yyyy-mm-dd_HH.MM.SS>.csv is the following:
```
n5_minute|network_element_name|rttd|pl12|jitter||pl3||300
```
### 4. Analyze rttd Computation Logic
4. Ckeck the implementation for each metric:
eg rttd:
Check the formula from file: https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/docs/19025_abc%20VPN%20Customers%20SLA%20@%20BigStreamer%20User%20and%20Administrator%20Guide%20v2.3.docx
```
rttd = sumofrtt / numofrtt
```
### 5. Review Implementation Logic in compute_qos_kpis.sh
If <b>numofrtt</b> is 0 or NULL check the query implementaion in the file: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/compute_qos_kpis.sh`
In our case numofrtt is 0, so the implementation puts the character:"" in the output file.
```sql
...
case when rank=1 then if(NONNULLVALUE(r.numofrtt) && NONNULLVALUE(r.sumofrtt) && r.Numofrtt!=0 , cast(cast(r.SumOfRTT/r.NumOfRTT AS DECIMAL(20,1)) AS STRING),'')
                        else ''
                        end as rttd,
                        '' as pl3
...
```
## Our Ticket Response
after investigation we saw that for the specific measurements the implementation throws a blank in the cases where the denominator of the formula is zero.
Checked the readings we got from the probe and saw that the ones used as the denominator are zero resulting in a gap in the readings you are seeing.
