# abc - IM1382364 - Energy efficiency info update
## Description
This task involves monitoring the pollaploi table to confirm it is updated whenever a new file arrives and diagnosing why recent data may not have been ingested.
Please let us know whenever the pollaploi table in schema energy efficiency is updated. 
Also to investigate why an update has not been made based on the latest file.
## Actions Taken
1. ssh un2 with your personal account
2. sudo -iu intra
3. sftp `bigd@172.16.166.30`
4. cd energypm
5. ls -ltr
6. Open HUE dashboard and search for `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi` Workflow
7. Check if workflow failed.
8. ssh `un2` with your personal account.
9. sudo -i
10. less `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.date.log` and less `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.next_date.log`. The next date should return no changes.
> Confirm that the log mentions "no new data" or similar, indicating no update was needed.
11. At un2 `wc -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/2020_10_pollaploi.txt`
12. Connect toImpala using impala-shell and execute `select count(*) from energy_efficiency.pollaploi`
> The number of rows in the 2020_10_pollaploi.txt file (from `wc -l`) should match the row count in the pollaploi table.
13. The row counts from step 11 and step 12 must match
14. Check on Impala Queries UI if the queries ran without exception `STATEMENT RLIKE '.*energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi.*'`
