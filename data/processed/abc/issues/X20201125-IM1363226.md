# abc - BigStreamer - IM1363226 - abc BigStreamer csi_fixed coollection issue
## Description
 CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt was exported empty
## Actions Taken
1. Login to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `mtuser` with sudo
2. Inspect logs of *CSI fix* flow. Nfgh that filename format is `CSI_fix_<mmddyyyy>_w<week>.txt` and that there is a 2 day delay between the export time and the exported data. In this case there was a problem with the file containing data for 2020-11-22 which was exported at 2020-11-24. So we checked the logs for 2020-11-24. 
```bash
cd /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log
less sai_csi.cron.20201124.log
```
3. Check if the source table contained data for the export date.
In `sai_csi.cron.20201124.log`:
``` bash
Query: use `sai`
Query: select nvl ... from sai.cube_indicators_it where par_dt='20201122'
...
Fetched 0 row(s) in 0.06s
Problem with 20201122.
```
4. Check if the source table contains data for this date. Please nfgh that the source table is just a view of table `brond.cube_indicators`.
``` bash
impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query="select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;";
...
count(*),par_date
2454925,20201118
2453089,20201119
2458393,20201123
```
5. Identify Missing Data in brond.cube_indicators. Since 3 dates are missing 2020/11/20-22, we need to run the workflow that populates `brond.cube_indicators`. But first we have to make sure all its table dependecies are loaded. Execute the following queries in an impala-shell or an Impala editor in Hue and make sure not only that partitions exist for those dates but also that there are an identical amount of lines.
```sql
select count(*), par_dt
from brond.brond_retrains_hist
where par_dt >= '20201118'
group by 2
order by 2;
...
count(*),par_dt
2499833,20201118
2497948,20201119
*2496522,20201120*
*2497810,20201121*
*2497480,20201122*
2496932,20201123
2497130,20201124
2505791,20201125
``` 
Execute the same query for tables:
- brond.fixed_radio_matches_unq_inp
- brond.fixed_brond_customers_daily_unq
- radius.radacct_hist
- brond.brond_retrains_hist
- brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist
This confirms the root cause: the brond.cube_indicators table lacked data for these dates, resulting in empty CSI_fix exports.
6. Rerun Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators for Missing Partitions. Run Cube_Indicators workflow. Login to Hue as intra and navigate to Workflows > Dashboards > Coordinators. Search for `Coord_Cube_Spark_Indicators` and click on the coordinator to view its executions. Select **one** at a time of the executions that need to be repeated. Nfgh that `brond.cube_indicators` is populated with a 2 day delay so if we want to load data for 2020-11-20 we have to execute the workflow of 2020-11-22. Select the execution from the check box and click `Rerun`. 
7. After each workflow execution repeat the query of step 4 to verify that table has been loaded. 
``` bash
impala-shell -i un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:22222 -d brond -l --ssl -u mtuser --ldap_password_cmd /home/users/mtuser/check.sh  --query="select count(*), par_date from brond.cube_indicators where par_date >= '20201118' group by 2 order by 2;";
...
count(*),par_date
2454925,20201118
2453089,20201119
2454321,20201120
2458393,20201123
```
8. Gather dates that need to be exported. As we saw in step 5 the source table was empty for 3 partitions: 20201120, 20201121, 20201122. The files produced for them was empty. Verify by checking `/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log`:
```bash
2020-11-21 09:01:39  CSI_fix_11212020_w47.txt  20201119  2453089
2020-11-22 09:00:43  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  0
2020-11-23 09:28:14  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  0
2020-11-24 09:01:01  CSI_fix_11242020_w47.txt  20201122  0
2020-11-25 09:03:13  CSI_fix_11252020_w48.txt  20201123  2458393
```
*CSI fix* provides a mechanism to avoid manual re-export of empty files. The most recent date of an empty file is stored in a table and automatically exported with the next execution. To view the date stored issue the query:
```bash
select * from refdata.mediation_csi_load_info;
...
load_time,flow_name
NULL,sai.mob
20201122,sai.fix
```
So we don't need to export manually date 20201122, only dates 20201120 & 20201121.
9. Manually Export CSI_fix Files Using export_csi_fix.sh. Finally, to export the files we have to repeat step 1 and execute the export script **sequentially** for the desired dates + 2 days:
```bash
/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201122 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &
/shared/abc/export_sai_csi/export_csi_fix.sh 20201123 >> /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/log/sai_csi.cron.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log 2>&1 &
```
This confirms the missing CSI_fix files were regenerated successfully with the expected number of lines.
10. Afterwards check the reconciliation log file that files have been exported:
```bash
less /shared/abc/export_sai_csi/logging/CSI_fix_reconciliation.log
...
2020-11-25 10:46:40  CSI_fix_11222020_w47.txt  20201120  4915294
2020-11-25 10:51:17  CSI_fix_11232020_w47.txt  20201121  2457858
```
The first one contains more lines as it includes dates 20201120 & 20201122.
