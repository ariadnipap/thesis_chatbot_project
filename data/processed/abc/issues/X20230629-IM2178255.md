title: CDSW Unavailability Due to Resource Exhaustion on All Worker Nodes
description: CDSW became unavailable due to all underlying nodes (mncdsw1, wrkcdsw1-6) reaching resource capacity, causing critical pods (web, tcp-ingress-controller, ds-reconciler) to become unready. No manual intervention was needed; services recovered once load decreased.

# abc - BDC - IM2178255 - CDSW Downtime Due to Host Resource Exhaustion
CDSW is not available. From the Cloudera manager we see the following:
Pods not ready in cluster default ['role/ds-reconciler', 'role/tcp-ingress-controller', 'role/web']. * Web is not up yet.
The nodes are all started and in good health.
## Actions Taken
After investigation we found out that in the time the issue has been assigned to our team **the resources of the CDSW hosts(mncdsw1,wrkcdsw1,wrkcdsw2,wrkcdsw3,wrkcdsw4,wrkcdsw5,wrkcdsw6) were maxed out** as we can see in the following pictures. The results of the following screenshot has been aggregated. 
Also, another step is the check @ mncdsw1 the cdsw status:
`cdsw status` and the health of the pods: `kubectl get pods -A` . 
At the time that we check the above mentioned status, all services and pods were healthy.

![cfgh_cdsw_host_load](.media/cfgh_cdsw_host_load.JPG)
Due to increased load in the above mentioned time frame the service was down.
