title: Location Mobility File Export Failure Due to SSH Permission Denial
description: Location Mobility file exports stopped on 2023-09-15 at 11:00 due to the `mtuser` not having SSH access to `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`, preventing the execution of the export script. Restored by reauthorizing the user.

The location mobility files are updated each day by running the following script:
```bash
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -i ./id_rsa mtuser@un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr "script"
```
This command initiates a remote execution of the export script by user `mtuser` on the primary data node `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`.
## Actions Taken
After investigating we found that the **mtuser** user did not have the necessary permissions and was not authorized to connect to the main server, so the script never ran.
After updating the permissions for the user, the script started running again.
You can verify that the script is executing correctly by logging into the Hue Server and opening the Oozie Editor. Filter workflows by user `mtuser` to see the status of scheduled jobs.
