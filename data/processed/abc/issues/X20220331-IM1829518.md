# abc - BigStreamer - IM1829518 -  missing data  aums.archive_data
## Description
aums schema archive_data table has not loaded data for 03/30/2022
## Actions Taken
### 1. Check Partition in HDFS
1.  Login to un2 and change to intra user with `sudo su - intra ` command
2.  Give the following command in order to check the wanted partition
```bash
[intra@un2 ~]$ sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -ls /ez/warehouse/aums.db/archive_data/par_dt=20220330`
```
You must be able to see the following ouput 
```bash
ls: /ez/warehouse/aums.db/archive_data/par_dt=20220330': No such file or directory
```
### 2. Refresh and Verify Table in Impala
3.  Connect to impala with `intra` user in order to refresh the table
` > refresh aums.archive_data;`
4.  Check if you can see the missing data with the following command from impala using `intra` user:
```bash
> show files in aums.archive_data partition (par_dt>='20220329');
```
If not then let's check the sftp server. You will notice that files for 31/03/2022 also missing.
### 3. Validate Files on SFTP Server
5.  From un2: `ssh bigd@172.16.166.30/;`
```bash
sftp> ls aums
```
You must be able to see the zip files : aems_data_20220329233417.zip and aems_data_20220330233347.zip for 30/03/2022 and 31/03/2022.
### 4. Re-download and Re-upload Missing Files
6. Lets try to put those file to a local directory, remove them and upload them with the following commands: 
```bash
[intra@un2 data_aums]$ sftp bigd@172.16.166.30
```
Connected to 172.16.166.30.
Locally transfer the file for 30/03/2022:
```bash
sftp> get aems_data_20220330233347.zip
```
Remove file:
```bash
sftp> rm  aems_data_20220330233347.zip
```
Locally transfer the file for 31/03/2022:
```bash
sftp> get aems_data_20220331233417.zip
```
Remove file:
```bash
sftp> rm  aems_data_20220331233417.zip
```
Now, let's upload those files again:
```bash
sftp> put aems_data_20220330233347.zip`
sftp> put aems_data_20220331233417.zip
```
### 5. Verify Partition Reload via Impala
7. Streamsets won't upload those files simultaneously. You will be able to see first the partition for 30/03/2022 and secondly partition for 31/03/2022.
From impala shell with `intra` user run the following command and make sure you will be able to see the missing partitions
```bash
> show files in aums.archive_data partition (par_dt>='20220330');
```
### 6. Monitor Streamsets Logs
8. Check logs at un2:/shared/sdc/log
