title: refdata.rd_cells Not Updated Due to Script Synchronization Race Condition
description: The `refdata.rd_cells` table was not updated on 2023-09-12 due to a race condition between `210_refData_Load.sh` and `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` caused by asynchronous execution of separate Cloudera coordinators. Resolved by adding `set SYNC_DDL=1` to ensure synchronization.

  root_cause: `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` ran before `210_refData_Load.sh` finished, causing `refdata.rd_cells` to reflect outdated data

# abc - BigStreamet - IM2215792 - refdata.rd_cells Not Updated Due to Script Synchronization Race Condition
## Description
refdata.rd_cells was not loaded by refdata.
```sql
rd_cells_load
select max(par_dt) from refdata.rd_cells_load  --> 20230911
select max(refdate) from refdata.rd_cells -->  20230910
```
This resulted in refdata.rd_cells reflecting data from 20230910 instead of 20230911, even though the load job had successfully ingested the latest partition into refdata.rd_cells_load.
## Actions Taken
At path `/shared/abc/refdata/bin` there is the script `210_refData_Load.sh` that at the beginning of each day loads the reference data at the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table and then updates the table so that this data appears as the latest data for other tables. At the same path there is the script `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` that loads the reference data from the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table to the `refdata.rd_cells` table, so that the two tables have the latest data recorded. These actions are handled by different server coordinators of cloudera manager. 
We checked the log files for each month at the `/shared/abc/refdata/log` path to see which coordinator was responsible for these processes at September 12. After that we logged in Cloudera Manager, and checked the log files at the specific time interval. We found that due to synchronization issues , the coordinator that updated `refdata.rd_cells` updated it before the procedure that refreshed the data at  `refdata.rd_cells_load` so it read the data from the previous date.
The solution was to add the parameter **set SYNC_DDL=1** at the necessary scripts so there are no synchronization issues.
The logs at cloudera manager are deleted after a certain period of time, so they need to be checked soon after the ticket.
