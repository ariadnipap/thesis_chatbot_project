title: Reduction in sai.voice_quality_hist Table Entries Due to Fewer Source Files
description: Investigation and root cause analysis of a drop in row counts for the `sai.voice_quality_hist` table from 2021-11-23 onward. Covers log analysis, file volume comparison between dates, validation of successful processing via `.LOADED` suffixes, and confirmation that the issue originated from the source system sending fewer files.

# abc - BigStreamer/backend - SD1780064 - IM1726312 - Reduction in sai.voice_quality_hist Table Entries Due to Fewer Source Files
## Description
This case investigates a noticeable drop in rows in sai.voice_quality_hist from 2021-11-23 due to fewer raw .dat files sent by the external system fgh.
## Actions Taken
### Flow Information (TRN File)
Get info about flow from "trn" file:
more unc2:/shared/abc/traffica/DataParser_voice_quality/scripts/transferlist/01_traffica_voice_quality.trn
- files incomming directly from fgh
- under  spool_area="/data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica"
- file_type="TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc*"
- suffix=".dat"
- load_suffix="LOADED"
nfgh: all files with the ".LOADED" extention have been successfully processed.
check only for ".dat" files without the ".LOADED" extention , to see if something was wrong.
### Table Verification
Verify for previous dates (table only has data for 7 days):
```sql
select par_dt, count(*) cnt from sai.voice_quality_hist group by 1 order by 1;
par_dt   | cnt     
---------+---------
20211122 | 24175236   <-- normal rows
20211123 | 21502579
20211124 | 17456051
20211125 | 18409272
20211126 | 18729343
20211127 | 14049150
20211128 | 10861604   <-- fewer rows
20211129 | 17729519
20211130 | 19021196
20211201 |  9955414   <-- not completed yet (today)
```
### File Volume Comparison
Then compare files from day with problem
eg:
```bash
[root@unc2 ~]# ll /data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica/TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc_TRAVQTNES_20211128* | wc -l 
4658
```
and comrare with a good one :
```bash
[root@unc2 ~]# ll /data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica/TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc_TRAVQTNES_20211121* | wc -l
5764
```
also compare rows contained in above files:
```bash
[intra@unc2 Traffica]$ cat /data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica/TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc_TRAVQTNES_20211128* | wc -l
11155058
[intra@unc2 Traffica]$ cat /data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica/TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc_TRAVQTNES_20211121* | wc -l 
16411173
```
### Root Cause Summary
The ingestion scripts ran without error. The reduced row count is directly correlated to a reduced number of input files from fgh. There is no local issue with processing or parsing. Source system must be consulted for missing data.
## Our Ticket Response
Upon checks, it was found that less raw data (files) have been sent
compared to previous days.
Indicatively we received
- Sunday 2021/11/21 : 5764 files, 16411173 rows
- Sunday 2021/11/28 : 4658 files, 11155058 rows
Also no problem was found regarding
loading the available (less) data into the given table
Please check the production of the raw data.
