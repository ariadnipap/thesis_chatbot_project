# abc - BigStreamer - IM1336999 - abc BigStreamer SM-MISSING DATA
## Description
Since 27/10/2020 12:40 pm 3 files have not been registered to EEM due to delays. Normal offset is 8 minutes e.g. metrics for 13:05 have to be transferred to the exchange directory before 13:13.
## Actions Taken
1. In the screenshot sent via email there is one file is missing for 13:05 and three files have been delayed from 13:55 to 14:05
2. Login to `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account and change to `ipvpn` with sudo
3. Inspect logs of *export component files* flow
```bash
cd /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/
less initiate_export_components.cron.20201027.log
```
3. Check messages for missing file
``` bash
[2020/10/27 13:13:00] - ERROR: file=/shared/abc/ip_vpn/nnm_flume/CPU_LOAD_2020-10-27_13.05.00.csv is empty.
[2020/10/27 13:13:00] - ERROR: file=/shared/abc/ip_vpn/nnm_flume/MEM_USAGE_2020-10-27_13.05.00.csv is empty.
```
4. Check Impala queries execution for that file
For `CPU_LOAD`:
```bash
less compute_cpu_kpis.20201027.log
...
Query: SELECT straight_join a.min_5 AS time,
...
    a.component_type='CPU' AND
   a.min_5='2020-10-27 13:05:00' AND
    a.par_dt='20201027'
...
Query submitted at: 2020-10-27 13:12:51
...
Fetched 0 row(s) in 8.68s
INFO: CPU file exported.
Tue Oct 27 13:13:00 EET 2020
```
For `MEM_USAGE`:
``` bash
less compute_memory_kpis.20201025.log
...
Query: SELECT straight_join a.min_5 AS time,
...
a.component_type='MEMORY' AND
a.min_5='2020-10-27 13:05:00' AND
a.par_dt='20201027'
...
Query submitted at: 2020-10-27 13:12:50
...
Fetched 0 row(s) in 9.00s
INFO: Memory file exported.
Tue Oct 27 13:13:00 EET 2020
```
5. Check input metrics table
Execute the Impala query either from Hue or impala-shell
```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist a
WHERE        
    a.min_5='2020-10-27 13:05:00' AND
    a.par_dt='20201027';
Result = 4286
```
6. Inspect logs of input metrics ingestion
```bash
less /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20201027.log
...
[2020/10/27 13:11:03] - INFO - /bin/mv /data/1/nnm_components_LZ/spooldir/BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20201027130601110.20201027_111102UTC.csv.tmp /data/1/nnm_components_LZ/spooldir/BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20201027130601110.20201027_111102UTC.csv
...
```
Input metrics file has been loaded before the execution of the export query. So queries in step 4 should have returned about 1260 rows. This needs further investigation on why even after the table has been refreshed the query returns the wrong result. The discrepancy between available data and query results needs further investigation. Nfghd as Action Point 1.
3. Check messages for delayed files
``` bash
[2020/10/27 14:03:04] - INFO: Copied files /shared/abc/ip_vpn/nnm_flume/CPU_LOAD_2020-10-27_13.55.00.csv at /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm
[2020/10/27 14:03:04] - INFO: Copied files /shared/abc/ip_vpn/nnm_flume/MEM_USAGE_2020-10-27_13.55.00.csv at /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm
...
[2020/10/27 14:08:09] - INFO: Copied files /shared/abc/ip_vpn/nnm_flume/CPU_LOAD_2020-10-27_14.00.00.csv at /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm
[2020/10/27 14:08:09] - INFO: Copied files /shared/abc/ip_vpn/nnm_flume/MEM_USAGE_2020-10-27_14.00.00.csv at /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm
...
[2020/10/27 14:14:04] - INFO: Copied files /shared/abc/ip_vpn/nnm_flume/CPU_LOAD_2020-10-27_14.05.00.csv at /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm
[2020/10/27 14:14:04] - INFO: Copied files /shared/abc/ip_vpn/nnm_flume/MEM_USAGE_2020-10-27_14.05.00.csv at /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm
```
Since SFTP GET occurs on 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th etc minute of every hour, the files above should have been transferred in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/saismpm` before 14:03, 14:08, 14:13 respectively.
4. Check Impala queries execution for those files
For `CPU_LOAD`:
``` bash
less compute_cpu_kpis.20201027.log
...
Tue Oct 27 14:02:02 EET 2020
Starting Impala Shell using LDAP-based authentication
...
INFO: CPU file exported.
Tue Oct 27 14:03:00 EET 2020
...
...
Tue Oct 27 14:07:07 EET 2020
Starting Impala Shell using LDAP-based authentication
...
INFO: CPU file exported.
Tue Oct 27 14:08:09 EET 2020
...
...
Tue Oct 27 14:12:06 EET 2020
Starting Impala Shell using LDAP-based authentication
...
INFO: CPU file exported.
Tue Oct 27 14:14:03 EET 2020
```
Same for `MEM_USAGE`.
The cause of the delays is the duration time of the Impala queries. To reduce the times we need to investigate if the schema of bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist can be improved, if we can delete the `REFRESH nnmnps.nms_node ...` queries etc. This should be analyzed further (see Action Point 2) to determine if schema optimization or query logic simplification can reduce query execution time. Nfghs as Action Point 2.
## Affected Systems
abc Bigstreamer Backend
## Action Points
1. Investigate empty response of Impala query for 13:05 even after refreshing the table
2. Investigate slightly increased response times of Impala queries and ways to reduce them.
