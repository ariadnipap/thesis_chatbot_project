# abc - IM1421557 - CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt file with no data 
## Description
This issue occurred due to missing records in a dependent partition of the brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist table used in the CSI fix pipeline. The result was an empty export for CSI_fix_01212021_w03.txt.
Yesterday's file was zero.

## Actions Taken
1. Execute steps 1-5 from [this doc](knowledge-base/abc/BigStreamer/20201125-IM1363226.md)
2. After the check we saw that table `brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist` had no data for 20210119 and 20210120, even though upstream tables were populated.
```bash
select count(*), par_dt
from brond.dsl_stats_week_xdsl_hist
where par_dt >= '20210115'
group by 2
order by 2;
Result:
count(*)	par_dt	
...
2491814	20210117	
2491872	20210118	
2494261	20210121	
...
```
3. Check coordinator `coord_brond_load_dsl_daily_stats` that populates this table as explained in [here](systems-info/abc/BigStreamer/Brond/cube_indicators_pipeline.md). 
4. Check that source tables `brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week` and `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week` have data for these partitions. Same query for `brond.brond_adsl_stats_week`
```sql
select count(*), par_dt
from brond.brond_vdsl_stats_week
where par_dt >= '20210115'
group by 2
order by 2;
Result:
count(*)	par_dt	
...
1806006	20210116	
1806256	20210117	
1806306	20210118	
1808049	20210119	
1808918	20210120	
1810234	20210121	
1811401	20210122	
```
As source tables have data, we have to execute only the missing inserts for the affected partitions.
> Since both ADSL and VDSL source tables contained data for `20210119` and `20210120`, the issue is isolated to the execution of the DSL stats coordinator.
5. Impala insert queries are under `/user/intra/brond_dsl_stats/impala-shell/populate*.sql`. Change conditions `..par_dt > '20210127..` to get the dates that are missing. In this case `20210119`. Execute the queries using Hue or impala-shell.
6. Repeat step 2 to validate that data are loaded correctly for missing dates.
7. Complete steps 6-10 from [this doc](knowledge-base/abc/BigStreamer/20201125-IM1363226.md).
