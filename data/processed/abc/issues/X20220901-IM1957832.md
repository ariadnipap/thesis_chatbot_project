# abc - IM1957832 - Cloudera AlertPublisher - No Email Alerts Observed
## Description
No alerts from cloudera. We noticed that since yesterday morning, alerts have stopped coming from the cloudera manager.
A test mail was sent today from the cloudera manager which came normally but the automatic mails we receive every day have stopped.
## Actions Taken
### 1. Log Inspection on un5 Node
- Ssh to **un5**  Alert Publisher Node and check the following files for error:
```
less /var/log/messages
less /var/log/mail.err 
less /var/log/mail.info 
less /var/log/cloudera-scm-alertpublisher
less mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out
```
### 2. Historical Alert Frequency Analysis
- Use the following commands as example to check the above log file in order to count how many alerts are in the logs and you can grep depending on month,date and the message. 
```bash
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Generated subject [Cloudera Alert]' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'has become bad' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'has become bad' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done
```
### 3. Preventive Restart
- _Preventively step_ Restart Alert Publisher through Cloudera Manager
### Conclusion
AlertPublisher was functioning normally. The temporary absence of automated email alerts was due to a drop in alert volume during a national vacation period. No system misconfiguration or failure was detected.
From the above investigation we came up to the result that no issues were found with the email alerting system; the absence of alerts was due to reduced system activity during the vacation period.
