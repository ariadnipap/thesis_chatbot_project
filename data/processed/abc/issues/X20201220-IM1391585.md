# abc - IM1391585 - issue BigStreamer
## Description
Please check immediately if BigStreamer is working properly.
We have received many alerts over the weekend and today regarding HDFS, for various nodes as well as for services (eg oozie). We also noticed problems with geolocation streams and loc mob files.
## Actions Taken
1. Connect with personal creds `https://172.25.37.232:7183` Cloudera Manager
2. Both Namenodes entered standby mode simultaneously which caused bad health on HDFS,HBASE,OOZIE,IMPALA. After nn1 restarted nn2 became the Active and nn1 the Standby namenode. All the other services was stable after this manual action except HBASE which restarted.
> The dual-standby state of both Namenodes caused a loss of HDFS coordination, which cascaded failures to other dependent services like HBase, Oozie, and Impala. After restarting nn1, high availability was restored with nn2 becoming active.
3. Since all services were stable check HUE `https://172.25.37.236:8888/oozie/list_oozie_workflows/` to ensure that all workflows running.
4. The specific timeline which namenodes crashed the load,cpu,network,hdfs_read/write,nodes health,,namenodes health,impala queries if something heavy executed,yarn applications if something heavy executed `http://10.20.9.82:5601/app/kibana`
5. Opened a case on Cloudera with namenodes diagnostics.
## Affected Systems
abc Bigstreamer
## Action Points
Monitor the status/health of services and inform with mail/alert when a service/role is down.
