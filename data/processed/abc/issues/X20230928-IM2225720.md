title: Neighbor Tool API Failure Due to Expired JDBC Password
description: The Neighbor Tool interface with Solvatio failed due to the expiration of the `neighb_user` Impala JDBC password, resulting in authentication errors on API calls. Resolved via JMX UI by updating the password in the Impala JDBC URL and restarting Wildfly.

# abc - BigStreamer - IM2225720 - Neighbor Tool - Solvatio Interface Failure
## Description
The Solvatio interface with the Neighbor tool does not work.
The password of the user neighbor_user expired, we reset it but when we hit the url https://cne.fgh.gr/bigstreamer-api/rest/neighbourAlgorithm/2109700572 (the fixed one you see is mine and you can use it for testing reasons) returns:
```
{"error": "org.springframework.jdbc.CannotGetJdbcConnectionException: Could not get JDBC Connection; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: [Cloudera][ImpalaJDBCDriver](500164) Error initialized or created transport for authentication: [Cloudera][ImpalaJDBCDriver](500592) Authentication failed..", "message": "Could not get JDBC Connection; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: [Cloudera][ImpalaJDBCDriver](500164) Error initialized or created transport for authentication: [Cloudera][ImpalaJDBCDriver](500592) Authentication failed.."}
```
## Root Cause Analysis
In order to check the logs of this we did the following:
```bash
ssh unekl1/unekl2
su - wildfly
bash
```
ckeck logs:
```bash
ekltaillog
```
## Resolution
The issue was caused by the expiration of the JDBC user password (`neighb_user`). After obtaining a new password from ABC Admin or the project's PM, we logged in to the JMX UI to apply the change.
## Actions Taken
```
https://172.25.37.247:8543/serviceweaver/jmx/
```
[login_info](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/abc-syspasswd.kdbx?ref_type=heads)
And under `servers -> com.xyz.abc_nts.bigstreamer_api.util -> mbeans -> name=BigStreamerApiJmxConfig -> attributes -> ImpalaURL` we change the password.
Update the `PWD` value with the new password received from abc. Be sure not to change the rest of the connection string.
```
jdbc:impala://172.25.37.237:21090;SSL=1;AuthMech=3;UID=neighb_user;PWD=HERE_ENTER_PASSWORD;
```
Retrieve the password from the abc Admin or xyz's PM
Then start the wildfly service or restart:
start wildfly:
`ekl-start`
For checks of the api from Haproxy : 
```
https://cne.fgh.gr/bigstreamer-api/rest/neighbourAlgorithm/phone_number_provided_from_abc
```
For checks of the API directly from the servers:
```
https://unekl1/bigstreamer-api/rest/neighbourAlgorithm/phone_number_provided_from_abc
https://unekl2/bigstreamer-api/rest/neighbourAlgorithm/phone_number_provided_from_abc
```
