title: Cloudera Agent Memory Leak on idm2.bigdata.abc.gr Due to Parcel Download Loop
description: The Cloudera Manager Agent (`cmf-agent`) on idm2.bigdata.abc.gr entered a high memory usage state due to a known Cloudera bug causing a memory leak while attempting to download stale parcels. The issue was resolved by removing the host from the cluster and restarting the agent.

  action_taken:
    - Identified excessive memory usage by cmf-agent
    - Verified parcel download loop in Cloudera Manager UI

# abc - IM2352302 - idm2.bigdata.abc.gr Change to Faulty State
## Description
idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --> Not Healthy state.
## Actions Taken
1. After checking the error on Cloudera Manager idm2.bigdata.abc.gr briefly entered a 'Not Healthy' state due to memory swapping. Host monitoring graphs showed memory usage exceeding 60 GB out of the available 64 GB.
2. Logged in with SSH and checked memory per process
``` bash
ps aux --sort -rss
```
3. The top process consuming memory was `cmf-agent`, which is the Cloudera Manager Agent process. After a quick search we found the following bug [Cloudera bug: OPSAPS-59764: Memory leak in the Cloudera Manager agent while downloading the parcels](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud-base/7.1.8/manager-release-nfghs/topics/cm-known-issues-773.html)
4. To verify that this bug is triggered we checked the parcel page of Cloudera Manager and we found that two hosts (`idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`/`idm2.bigdata.abc.gr`) where constantly trying to download some of the parcels that are distributed, but not available anymore.
5. We proposed to the client to remove the two hosts from the logical cluster, since they did not have any roles.
```
From Cloudera Manager
Hosts > All Hosts > Check `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` and `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` > Actions > Remove from Cluster
```
```bash
systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent
```
6. After removing the two hosts from the cluster and restarting the Cloudera Manager Agent memory consumption for the two hosts has remained stable.
