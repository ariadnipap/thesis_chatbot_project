# abc - IM1631218 - huawei tv  
## Description
Load the tables huawei_tv.rel_play_tv_hist, huawei_tv.rel_play_tvod_hist, huawei_tv.rel_play_vod_hist for 31/8-1/9 and huawei_tv.rel_vod_info_hist for 1/9 with data.
Request to backfill missing partitions for 20210831 and 20210901 across multiple `huawei_tv` history tables due to previously ingested empty CSVs.
## Actions Taken
### Partition Verification in Impala
1. Login to Hue and go to `Editor` > `Impala`
2. Check for missing partitions as stated in description
```sql
select count(*), par_dt 
from huawei_tv.rel_vod_info_hist  
where par_dt between '20210825' and '20210905' 
group by par_dt 
order by par_dt;
Result:
count(*)	par_dt	
...
15026	20210830	
14728	20210901	
14748	20210902	
...
```
3. Partition for `20210831` is actually missing but `20210901` is here and seems fine.
### Check Ingestion Logs and Confirm Data Mappings
4. Check logs of flow but first login to `un2`. And yes, huawei tv loads data for yesterday's partition from today's table #crazyright
``` bash
$ su - intra
$ cd /shared/abc/huawei_tv/
$ less log/huawei_tv_load.20210901.log
...
SFTP get files from : ./export/20210901
Connected to 172.28.128.150.
sftp> get export/20210901/*.csv /data/1/huawei_tv_LZ/
Fetching /export/20210901/EPG_SCHEDULE.csv to /data/1/huawei_tv_LZ/EPG_SCHEDULE.csv
Fetching /export/20210901/REL_PLAY_TV.csv to /data/1/huawei_tv_LZ/REL_PLAY_TV.csv
Fetching /export/20210901/REL_PLAY_TVOD.csv to /data/1/huawei_tv_LZ/REL_PLAY_TVOD.csv

Fetching /export/20210901/REL_VOD_INFO.csv to /data/1/huawei_tv_LZ/REL_VOD_INFO.csv
```
### Inspect Source Files on SFTP Server
5. Let's inspect those files
```bash
$ sftp bigdata@172.28.128.150:/export
sftp> cd 20210901
sftp> ls -l
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0          476541 Sep  1 05:13 EPG_SCHEDULE.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0               0 Sep  1 05:11 REL_PLAY_TV.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0               0 Sep  1 05:10 REL_PLAY_TVOD.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0               0 Sep  1 05:11 REL_PLAY_VOD.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0         3470903 Sep  1 05:11 REL_VOD_INFO.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0        11414886 Sep  1 05:13 SubscriberID_STBMACAddress_Relationship.csv
```
### Root Cause and Recovery
As it is obvious, there are empty files, so abc needs to reload data into the remfgh server and we need to run the script for the missing partition:
```bash
$ /shared/abc/huawei_tv/bin/huawei_tv_load.sh 20210831
```
## Affected Systems
abc Bigstreamer
## Action Points
We have informed abc about each case and wait for their response.
Partition `20210901` is fine but `20210831` needs manual action as nfghd in step 5.
