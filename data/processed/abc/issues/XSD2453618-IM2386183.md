# abc - IM2386183 - Disable Nagios Notifications from nagios@bigdata.abc.gr
## Description
Daily notification emails were being sent from `nagios@bigdata.abc.gr`, despite the monitoring alerts being non-critical and undesired by the customer. The customer confirmed they no longer wish to receive these Nagios notifications.

## Actions Taken
We initially contacted the customer and concluded that they wish not to receive any kind of notification anymore.
We therefore proceeded as follows:
1. Login as root on admin.bigdata.abc.gr
2. Check logs inside `/var/log/nagios/nagios.log`
Then we checked the basic configuration of nagios service:
```bash
cd /etc/nagios
vi nagios.cfg, where enable_notifications=1
```
3. We suggested to disable the notifications -> **enable_notifications=0** and to restart the nagios service again. After the change:
```bash
systemctl restart nagios
systemctl status nagio
```
4.  Log in the Nagios GUI (https://admin.bigdata.abc.gr/nagios) with our groupnet credentials and check the **Notifications** Tab. After the restart, incoming notifications stopped.
