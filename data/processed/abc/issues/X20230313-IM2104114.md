# abc - BigStreamer - IM2104114 -  mn3 bad health
## Description
The mn3 node is in bad health with the message:
This host has been out of contact with the Cloudera Manager Server for too long. This host is not in contact with the Host Monitor.
## Actions Taken
1. From `admin` tried to reach mn3 but with no response:
Attempt to verify connectivity from admin to mn3 node.
```bash
ping mn3
```
2. Since there is no response from `mn3` time to reboot server.
Login to `admin` from ad hoc connection and then type from command line `firefox`.
Select `default profile` and go to idrac for mn3 `https://10.255.242.85/` with the credentials you can find [here](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx).
3. From left Column click on `Server` and then go to `Logs`.
At that moment we see the following error for CPU:
```bash
Mon Mar 13 2023 08:44:27 CPU 1 machine check error detected.
Mon Mar 13 2023 08:44:27 CPU 2 machine check error detected.
Mon Mar 13 2023 08:44:27 CPU 1 machine check error detected.
```
4. Time to reboot server:
From `https://10.255.242.85/` go to Server and then click on `Power Cycle System (cold boot)`
5. In order to check that server is up and running open java console, otherwise check logs from left Column click on `Server` and then go to `Logs`
6. Login to Cloudera Manager with your personal account and then to `Hosts` -> `All hosts` and search for mn3.
Verify that it is back again to cluster.
7. Login to `admin` and then ssh to `mn3` in order to verify that cloudera agent is up and running.
```bash
systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent status
```
## Investigation
1. Investigated `/var/log/messages` and we saw bellow info:
```bash

As we see at `09:10:47` mn3 lost contact from Cloudera Manager.
2. Investigated below logs between time that problem occurred but we didn't find any useful information
```bash
journalctl -S "2023-03-13 08:00:00" -U "2023-03-13 10:50:00"
less /var/log/dmesg
less /var/log/cloudera-scm-agent/cloudera-scm-agent.log
```
## Affected Systems
abc Bigstreamer Master/Management Services
## Our Ticket Response
After investigation we noticed that there was a problem with the CPU due to some process and the node had to be rebooted in order to recover.
We will monitor the node and in case the problem appears again we will proceed with a ticket to Dell.
