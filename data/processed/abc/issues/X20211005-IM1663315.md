# abc - RStudio - login failure 04/10
## Description
RStudio Connect returned a license expiration message on 04/10. Attempts to connect failed due to inability to verify or reactivate the license. This was likely caused by system time issues or inability to reach the license server over HTTPS.
The message was the following:
```
An error has occurred
License Expired
Your RStudio Connect license has expired. Please contact your Customer Success representative or email sales@rstudio.com to obtain a current license.
```
## Actions Taken
### Initial Troubleshooting and Environment Preparation
1. ssh unrstudio1
2. Make sure the time zone is correct for the machine. (sudo timedatectl)
3. Resync the date and time of the machine. (sudo hwclock -w)
### Deactivation and Activation Attempt
4. /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager deactivate
```
Error deactivating product key: (19): Connection to the server failed. Ensure that you have a working internet connection, you've configured any required proxies, and your system's root CA certificate store is up to date; see https://rstudio.org/links/licensing_ssl for more information.
```
5. /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager activate <product-key>
```
Error verify: (19): The product is activated however the license manager is currently unable to connect to the license server to verify the activation.
Please ensure that you can make a connection to the activation server and then re-activate the product.
```
### Proxy Configuration for License Server Access
6. To pass the error from the step 4&5 then export `export http_proxy=<ip:port>` & 'export https_proxy=<ip:port>' 'export http_proxy=<ip:port>'
7. Try again to deactivate like step 4
### License Status and Verification
8. Try again to activate like step 5 and then run the below commands:
```bash
sudo /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager status
sudo /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager verify
/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager verify #run without sudo
```
### Service Restart
9. systemctl restart rstudio-connect # ONLY IF the Activaton Status on step 8 was `Activated`
10. systemctl status rstudio-connect
## Affected Systems
abc Bigstreamer Rstudio-Connect
### Troubleshooting Activation Error Code (13)
**In case you  receive the following error while executing step 5:**
```
Error activating product key: (13): The activation has expired or the system time has been tampered with. Ensure your time, timezone, and date settings are correct. If you're sure the license is not expired, try performing the following steps, in order: 
1. Fix the timezone on your system.
2. Fix the date on your system.
3. Fix the time on your system.
4. Perform a system restart (important!)
```
You must **reboot** your node and then repeat 1-10 steps
