title: Cyberark SSH Connection Fails Intermittently on Virtualop Node
description: Investigation of intermittent SSH connection failures to virtualop node (172.26.169.11) via Cyberark. Issue caused by restricted source IPs not included in `/etc/hosts.allow`. Resolved by whitelisting all Cyberark subnets.

# abc - BigStreamet - IM2211937 - virtualop ssh error
## Description
On the virtualop node - 172.26.169.11, sometimes we can connect via Cyberark with ssh and other times it shows us the attached error message.
Initial inspection of the SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) revealed no misconfigurations. We also restarted the sshd service, but the behavior remains.

## Actions Taken
1. After confirming the same problem on our end, ie connecting to the host through Cyberark, we login to the `admin` server first and then ssh into `virtualop`. We checked the sshd config under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for any glaring issues, but as was communicated by the customer, none were found.
2. The next step is to check `/var/log/secure` in order to see if the authentication issue is due to the host or if it doesn't even reach it. In there, while performing a test connection, we identified the following log entry `refused connect from 10.53.134.71 (10.53.134.71)` which signifies that the host itself refused the connection.
3. We check for the existence of `/etc/host.allow` and we added the above address, before testing again. The test failed again, this time with a diffrent IP being refused inside `/var/log/secure`, which lead us to believe that Cyberark is using multiple IPs and subnets to facilitate connections.
4. We requested all subnets used by Cyberark from the customer in order to add them to `/etc/hosts.allow` and after doing so no more connection issues appeared. One thing to nfgh here is that for any new subnets that Cyberark will use they must also be added to `/etc/hosts.allow` or the same connection issues will reappear.
