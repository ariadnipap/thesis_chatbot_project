# abc - BigStreamer - IM2201796 - Table  aums.archive_metadata not loaded
## Description
The aums.archive_metadata table is not loaded since 10/8.
## Actions Taken
We followed the troubleshooting steps described in [this](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/streamsets.md) support document.
1. Logged in to Streamsets (https://172.25.37.236:18636/) with `sdc` user and credentials found [here](../../abc-devpasswd.kdbx)
2. Checked `AUMS Metadata File Feed` pipeline status. It was running.
3. Checked pipeline's logs. There were no logs and there were no records found.
4. Login to un2 and then switch to user `intra`
5. Check files on sftp server
```bash
sftp bigd@172.16.166.30
cd aums
ls
```
There were multiple zip files that had not been processed by the pipeline.
6. Open an impala connection and check if there are any partitions created for the days the client had reported
```sql
secimp   
select count(*) from aums.archive_metadata where par_dt = '20230811';
select count(*) from aums.archive_metadata where par_dt = '20230812';
select count(*) from aums.archive_metadata where par_dt = '20230813';
```
The queries returned zero rows.
7. Then we proceeded with the manual data insertion described [here](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/streamsets.md#manually-inserting-missing-data-in-hive-and-impala). More specifically:
After the **put command at step 3** of the mentioned guide, continue with the following steps below(8-10).
8. Refreshed table on impala with `refresh aums.archive_metadata` and checked if new partitions were created (impaala queries at step 6). No new partitions had been created.
9. From Streamsets UI, stop and then start  `AUMS Metadata File Feed` pipeline. If stopping takes too long you can **Force Stop** the pipeline.
10. Then refresh impala again and ran queries about the days that the data was missing. The queries verified that data had loaded.
11. Since the pipeline successfully resumed and processed the missing metadata files:
- remove the <filename>_tmp.csv/zip file from the remfgh sftp directory with the sftp command rm <filename>_tmp.csv/zip. !IMPORTANT
- clear the local directory from the unnecessary fetched data.
