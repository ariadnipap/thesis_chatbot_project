## Description
We see that sn87 has a problem with the CPU (attached). It has gone out of cluster.
## Root Cause
sn87 was removed from the cluster due to a CPU-related hardware fault, verified through iDRAC logs. BIOS and iDRAC versions were outdated.
## Actions Taken
1. Check Idrac logs for the description error `Overview-->Server-->Logs`
2. Export the lifecycle logs `Overview-->Server-->Troubleshooting-->Support Assist-->Export Collection` and save the TSR*.zip
3. Open a case on DELL SUPPORT(2108129800). Dell need the service tag from `Overview` of Idrac
4. Send them the TSR*.zip
5. In this case necessary was the update of BIOS & Lifecycle Controller of Idrac
6. Dell send us the right update files based on our servers `PowerEdge C6320`
7. Updated the BIOS base on the link `https://downloads.dell.com/solutions/general-solution-resources/White%20Papers/Updating%20BIOS%20on%20Dell%2013G%20PowerEdge%20Servers.pdf`
(to update the BIOS via OS-CLI, see APPENDIX below )
8. Updated the Lifecycle Controller base on the link `https://dl.dell.com/topicspdf/idrac_2-75_rn_en-us.pdf`
(to update the Lifecycle Controller via OS-CLI, see APPENDIX below )
9. After the update of both versions the host was up with the roles stopped for 1 day.
10. After 1 day send the lifecycle logs like `Step 2` and forward the zip file to Dell.
11. If any error exist start the roles.
