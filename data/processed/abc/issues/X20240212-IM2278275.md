# abc - BigStreamer - IM2278275 Hue error
## Description
Impala & Hue queries from Hue fail with:
Could not start SASL: Error in sasl_client_start (-1) SASL(-1): generic failure: GSSAPI Error: Unspecified GSS failure. Minor code may provide more information (Ticket expired) (code THRIFTTRANSPORT): TTransportException('Could not start SASL: Error in sasl_client_start (-1) SASL(-1): generic failure: GSSAPI Error: Unspecified GSS failure. Minor code may provide more information (Ticket expired)',)
Applies to https://172.25.37.236:8888/hue ( un2) & Virtual https://172.25.37.237 :8888/hue .
Not for https://172.25.37.235:8888/hue (un1)
The cause was an outdated Kerberos ticket due to a Hue service restart that changed the keytab process path used by the scheduled `kinit` command.
## Actions Taken
As read from [here](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/manage_idm_replication.md#a-brief-history-of-preauthentication) we proceeded to the following steps:
1. List crontab entries and find entry for hue:
```bash
[root@un2 ~]# crontab -l | grep hue
```
Ouput:
```bash
### Hue Workaround ###
5 */2 * * * sudo -u hue /usr/bin/kinit -k -t /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/159288-hue-KT_RENEWER/hue.keytab -c /var/run/hue/hue_krb5_ccache hue/un2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR
```
2. Check if this file exists:
```bash
[root@un2 ~]# ll /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/159835-hue-KT_RENEWER/
ls: cannot access /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/159835-hue-KT_RENEWER/: No such file or directory
```
This occurs due to the fact that hue service had been restarted.
3. Find latest process for Kerberos ticket cache of Hue with ` ll -ltra /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/` and edit crontab with `crontab -e` and replace with the correct directory
4. Verify that problem is resolved by running below kinit command:
```bash
[root@un2 ~]#  sudo -u hue /usr/bin/kinit -k -t /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/159836-hue-KT_RENEWER/hue.keytab -c /var/run/hue/hue_krb5_ccache hue/un2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR
```
5. Go to hue `https://172.25.37.236:8888/hue` and run a sample command like `show databases;` to verify that you can perform querries
