# Missing or corrupted statistics
## Description
This document addresses how to detect and fix missing or corrupted table statistics in Impala. The issue affects both historical and streaming tables, with warnings appearing due to out-of-date or missing metadata. It includes steps for HDFS size verification, reviewing Impala table stats, running `compute stats`, and `refresh`, as well as caveats for high-frequency streaming tables like `sai.sms_raw`.
The following tables have potentially corrupt table statistics. Drop and re-compute statistics to resolve this problem. ->
sai.voice_quality_hist,
sai.sms_raw, 
sai.voice_raw,
brond.brond_retrains_hist,
brond.td_dslam_week,
ookla.ookla_android,
ookla.ookla_ios,
ookla.ookla_stnet,
temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms,
temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms
## Actions Taken
Tables like sai.sms_raw ingest data every 5 minutes, which makes real-time statistics invalid or misleading.
### HDFS Table Size Check
Run the following commands on un2 as user `intra` to inspect HDFS directory sizes of the affected tables:
```bash
hdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/sai.db/voice_quality_hist
hdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/brond.db/brond_retrains_hist
hdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/brond.db/td_dslam_week
hdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_android
hdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_ios
hdfs dfs -du -h -s /ez/warehouse/ookla.db/ookla_stnet
``` 
### Check Impala Table Stats
Review current statistics for the affected tables via the Impala shell:
```bash
show table stats  sai.voice_quality_hist               ;
show table stats  sai.sms_raw                          ;
show table stats  sai.voice_raw                        ;
show table stats  brond.brond_retrains_hist            ;
show table stats  brond.td_dslam_week                  ;
show table stats  ookla.ookla_android                  ;
show table stats  ookla.ookla_ios                      ;
show table stats  ookla.ookla_stnet                    ;
show table stats  temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms ;
show table stats  temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms   ;
```
### Recompute Statistics
Execute `compute stats` for the impacted tables. Note that for streaming tables, this may not be feasible during working hours:
```bash
compute stats   sai.voice_quality_hist               ;
compute stats   sai.sms_raw                          ;
compute stats   sai.voice_raw                        ;
compute stats   brond.brond_retrains_hist            ;
compute stats   brond.td_dslam_week                  ;
compute stats   ookla.ookla_android                  ;
compute stats   ookla.ookla_ios                      ;
compute stats   ookla.ookla_stnet                    ;
compute stats   temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms ;
compute stats   temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms   ;
```
Œùote: If there is a failure in any of the tables, run 'refresh' on this table.
### Refresh Failing Tables
Use `refresh` for any tables where `compute stats` fails due to corrupt metadata or loading conflicts:
```bash
refresh   sai.voice_quality_hist               ;
refresh   sai.sms_raw, sai.voice_raw           ;
refresh   brond.brond_retrains_hist            ;
refresh   brond.td_dslam_week                  ;
refresh   ookla.ookla_android                  ;
refresh   ookla.ookla_ios                      ;
refresh   ookla.ookla_stnet                    ;
refresh   temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms ;
refresh   temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms   ;
```
### Notes from Data Engineering (Dionysia)
The Data Engineering team clarified why stats appear to be missing or outdated for certain streaming tables:
After investigating the tables (sai.voice_quality_hist, sai.sms_raw, sai.voice_raw) we saw that we calculate statistics every morning for the previous day's data. These tables seem to fill up throughout the day, so the stats don't appear to be up to date.
The statistics refer to data in partitions of previous days.
- In terms of performance, it is not possible to run compute statistics on partitions that continuously receive data during the day.
There are streams that load data every 5 minutes.
Doing so would significantly delay data processing.
- Obviously, the queries that are executed include the current partition and that is why the Warning for missing statistics is displayed.
Attached you will find an example for sai.sms_raw for different par_dt, in which it appears that for historical data no warning is displayed.
If statistics are needed for specific tables, we should consider it as a project and not under Support. We should consider how the performance of the cluster is affected and make the right design, so that we can agree on the frequency that the statistics should be calculated.
