# Traffic from sender nagios@bigdata.abc.gr

<b>Description:</b>

Good evening,
Daily mail traffic with senders is observed

nagios@bigdata.abc.gr
 20241003063537.8E45B2031700@admin.bigdata.abc.gr

Notifications from nagios have not been working for some time.

Where does this movement come from?

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

We initially contacted the customer and concluded that they wish not to receive any kind of notification anymore.

We therefore proceeded as follows:

1. Login as root on admin.bigdata.abc.gr
2.  
```
Check logs inside /var/log/nagios/nagios.log

Then we checked the basic configuration of nagios service:

cd /etc/nagios
vi nagios.cfg, where enable_notifications=1
```
3. We suggested to disable the notifications -> **enable_notifications=0** and to restart the nagios service again. After the change:
```
systemctl restart nagios
systemctl status nagio
```
4.  Log in the Nagios GUI (https://admin.bigdata.abc.gr/nagios) with our groupnet credentials and check the **Notifications** Tab. Τα incoming notifications σταμάτησαν από τη στιγμή του restart και έπειτα.
