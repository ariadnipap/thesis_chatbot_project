After investigating the tables (sai.voice_quality_hist, sai.sms_raw, sai.voice_raw) we saw that we calculate statistics every morning for the previous day's data. These tables seem to fill up throughout the day, so the stats don't appear to be up to date.
The statistics refer to data in partitions of previous days.

- In terms of performance, it is not possible to run compute statistics on partitions that continuously receive data during the day.
There are streams that load data every 5 minutes.
Doing so would significantly delay data processing.

- Obviously, the queries that are executed include the current partition and that is why the Warning for missing statistics is displayed.
Attached you will find an example for sai.sms_raw for different par_dt, in which it appears that for historical data no warning is displayed.

If statistics are needed for specific tables, we should consider it as a project and not under Support. We should consider how the performance of the cluster is affected and make the right design, so that we can agree on the frequency that the statistics should be calculated.
