```

The location mobility files are updated each day by running the following script:

```
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -i ./id_rsa mtuser@un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr "script"
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

After investigating we found that the **mtuser** user did not have the necessary permissions and was not authorized to connect to the main server, so the script never ran.

After updating the permissions for the user, the script started running again.

We can check if the script is running , by logging in to `Hue Server` and checking the `Oozie Editor`  for workflows of `mtuser`.
