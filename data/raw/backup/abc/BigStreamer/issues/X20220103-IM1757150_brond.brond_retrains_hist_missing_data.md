LOGs: 
  - /shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/log/brond_rollout_cron.* for /shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/brond_retrains.pl
  - /shared/abc/brond/log/000_brond_retrains_ops.* for /shared/abc/brond/bin/000_brond_retrains_ops.sh
```

**Actions taken**:

1. Verify that there are no data for the corresponding par_dts (Impala shell) by choosing a convenient date:
```
select count(*), par_dt from brond.brond_retrains_hist where par_dt >= '20221231' group by 2 order by 2;
```
   No data was found for 1/1, 2/1, and 3/1.

2. By checking the **/shared/abc/brond/DataParser/scripts/log/brond_rollout_cron** log file, it was found out that the corresponding par_dts could not be created in Hive because their names, e.g. 20220101, could not be deduced. The brond_retrains.pl script deduces the name of the par_dt it will create by examining the name of the uploaded files on the SFTP server. The names of the uploaded files must have the following format:
Counter_Collection_24H.<number>_<yyyy>_<mm>_<dd>.csv
However, that was not the case for the files corresponding to those days.

3. We asked abc to re-upload the files with correct names.
