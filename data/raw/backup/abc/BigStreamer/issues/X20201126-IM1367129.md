<b>Description:</b>

```
Good evening,

We notice that no data is being loaded from 25/11/2020 at 07:00 on osix.sip.
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. ssh unosix1 with your personal account
2. sudo -iu osix
3. kinit -kt osix.keytab osix
4. yarn application -list | grep OSIX-SIP-NORM
5. In our case the topology was down and the kudu script didn't resubmit it.
6. Check if `coord_OsixStreaming_SIP_MonitorResubmit` is running.
7. Check if listeners is healthy and data inserted `http://172.25.37.251/dashboard/#osix_listeners`
8. The rate for `listen_sip_core` should be between 12K and 22K messages.If there is an extreme problem e.g. the rate is 0, consider restarting the problematic listener
9. Check the logs of monitor script `hdfs dfs -ls /user/osix/resubmit_topology/logs/logs_OSIX-SIP-NORM` and `hdfs dfs -cat /user/osix/resubmit_topology/logs/logs_OSIX-SIP-NORM/date_monitor_sip_norm.log`
10. Start again the topology `unosix1:/home/users/osix/topologies/binary-input-impala-output/sip_norm/` and execute `./submit_sip_norm.sh` until the state appeared `RUNNING`
11. yarn application -list | grep OSIX-SIP-NORM
12. Connect to impala-shell or Hue and execute `SELECT count(*), par_dt FROM osix.sip WHERE par_dt>'20201124' group by par_dt;` to check if the data inserted on the table.
