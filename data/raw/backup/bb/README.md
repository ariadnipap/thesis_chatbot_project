## BigStreamer

The BigStreamer installation consists of two Hadoop Big Data clusters, one primary and one disaster/recovery site.

The original installation was sized for accomodating two applications:

- IBANK

The audit logs of the mno's Internet Banking.

- ONLINE

The audit logs of the actions perfomed by mno's tellers.

Since the original installation additional applications have been installed by mno.
