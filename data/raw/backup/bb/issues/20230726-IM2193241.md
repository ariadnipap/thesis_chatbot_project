<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Re-run the failed step as described [here](../supportDocuments/applicationFlows/online.md#batch)
2. The flow completed successfully, we proceeded with the investigation

   Logs from the application:

   ```
   Caused by: org.apache.kudu.client.NonRecoverableException: cannot complete before timeout: ScanRequest(scannerId="22c757bfcf674a05a08f14c316e745e9", tablet=c42b07f18435403297fee37add478c0b, attempt=1, KuduRpc(method=Scan, tablet=c42b07f18435403297fee37add478c0b, attempt=1, TimeoutTracker(timeout=30000, elapsed=30004), Trace Summary(0 ms): Sent(1), Received(0), Delayed(0), MasterRefresh(0), AuthRefresh(0), Truncated: false

3. Stage 0 should have 180 partitions not 468

4. Informed development team to correct the number of partitions for `prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream`. This deleted unnecessary data from Kudu's disks and next run (see 3) did not have any failed tasks.
