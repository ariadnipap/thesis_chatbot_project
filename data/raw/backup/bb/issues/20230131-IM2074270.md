# mno - BigStreamer - IM2074270 - Failed Batch Job on Grafana

<b>Description:</b>

```bash
Good evening,

The following failed batch job appeared in the grafana system:

application : DWH_IBank
job_name : EXPORT
component : LOAN_PAYMENT
date : 30-01-2023
status : FAILED
description : code 6
host : -
```

</b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Check Loan Payment - Export Status from Grafana

   ```bash
   LOCAL MONITOR -> Batch Jobs DR -> DW Jobs
   ```

   The script excited with Code 6, which means that it timed-out, waiting for the Sqoop MapReduce job to be in running state.

2. Check Impala Query Status

   ```bash
   Cloudera Manager -> Impala -> Queries -> statement RLIKE '.*details_loan_payment.*' -> Search
   ```

   ![IM2074270_impala_queries](.media/IM2074270_impala_queries.png)

   Impala query ran successfully.

3. Check MapReduce job from YARN

   ![IM2074270_yarn_apps](.media/IM2074270_yarn_apps.png)

   There wasn't any job for Loan Payment,so it had never been submitted.

4. Check export logs

    ```bash
    #from dr1edge01
    less /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_export.log
    ```

   ![IM2074270_export_logs](.media/IM2074270_export_logs.png)

   There was a Connection Timed Out error from sqoop-eval which indicates a problem with the SQLServer.

5. Check export script

    ```bash
    #from dr1edge01
    less /opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/export_to_dwh.sh
    ```

   ![IM2074270_export_script](.media/IM2074270_export_script.png)

   As we can see in the image above, sqoop-export runs after sqoop-eval. In our case sqoop-export did not run because sqoop-eval exited with error.

6. Inform Customer and ask for a rerun

<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>

```bash
Good evening,

from the analysis of the logs we see that sqoop was not submitted because the evaluation for SQL Server was run first, which crashed with a Network I/O exception. (Connection Timed Out)

Please rerun the job.

We also see that the DWH started today at 12. Because at this time we have an increased chance of the SQL Server evaluation crashing as the traffic on it is increased, could you inform us why the execution of the DWH was delayed?

Thank you
```
