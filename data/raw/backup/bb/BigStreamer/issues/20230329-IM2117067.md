Title: Batch Job Failed
Body:
```
Hello,

Today 29/03 in Grafana application a failed Batch Job appeared.

Application : DWH_IBank
Job_Name : Extract
Component: MAN_DATE
Date: 28/03/23
Status: Failed
Description Code 1
```

Information regarding the extract, logs etc. available [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/datawarehouse-ibank.md#man-date-extract) 

Information regarding the export, logs etc. available [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/datawarehouse-ibank.md#man-date-export) 

</b>Actions Taken:</b>

We tried to invoke the Extract MAN_DATE script but it failed multiple times. After investigating the logs of the executor using internal firefox and the logs of the DWH_Ibank_MAN_DATE script we saw the following :

`Cannot insert dublicate key in object srcib.MandateDetails. The dublicate key value is (e5435435-4354254235-121nfdgd33)`


That means that the table already has records in it, so we have to drop this records or invoke the script with the `-f` option that gives the ability to trancate the table and then insert the records. 

```
/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_extract_details.sh -t manDate -f
```

After executing the extract script, we use the same `-f` to run the export script. The reason that we are running export is because in the above mentioned step we run the extract and trancated the table so the export is neccessary. 

```
/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/extract_details/sched_export_details.sh -t manDate -f
```

The issue has been resolved by executing the above two commands. The key in this case was to find in the logs that we have dublicate keys.
