# mno - BigStreamer - IM2271635 - PR NAVIGATOR CONNECTION ISSUES

<b>Description:</b>

```
Good morning everyone.

Please check if the Navigator in PR is functional because we often see messages like
haproxy[23876]: proxy cn_vip has no server available!

We also noticed that most of the time, when entering the Navigator web application, we receive a message
Failed to connect to the Navigator server, check your network connection and try again.
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. We executed the script located at `pr1node03.mno.gr:/opt/navigator_restart/apicluster.py` as `root`, documented at [Script for navigator metadata restart](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/200) which is used to restart the Cloudera Navigator Metadata server. However, the errors remained and we could not connect to the Navigator Metadata Server.


2. We connected to Cloudera Manager and used it to restart the Navigator Metadata Service. This restored the connection to the service.
