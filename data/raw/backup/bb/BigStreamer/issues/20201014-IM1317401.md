# mno - BigStreamer - IM1317401 - [PR][IBANK] Query Average Response Time alert

<b>Description:</b>

```
We have the following alert msg on Grafana.
[PR][IBANK] Query Average Response Time alert
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account
2. Inspected `[PR][IBANK] Query Average Response Time alert` graph

```
I edited the graph temporarily to display the max response time instead of the mean value. Usually the problem affects 3-4 queries and is due to user actions in the PR site.
These problematic queries add bias to the mean time and create the alarm. By checking the max values, I saw that that was the case.
