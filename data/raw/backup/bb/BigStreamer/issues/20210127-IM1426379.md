# mno - BigStreamer - IM1426379 - 2 Batch Job failed on dr1edge01.mno.gr

<b>Description:</b>

```
IBank_Migration - Enrich hbase tables - JOB & Impala_insert batch Job failed.
Fail SA daily upsert 2nd time.exit on dr1.edge01.mno.gr.
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to Grafana `https://dr1edge02.mno.gr:3000` with personal account
2. Inspected `LOCAL MONITORING`/`I-Bank Batch Jobs Overview` 
3. From the diagram stage `Enrich HBase Visible Tables` had failed
4. According to [Hadoop Trac](http://999.999.999.999/trac/hadoop/wiki/dev/project/mno/support), execution is done with the following command:
```
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`  >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log 2>&1
```
5. Connected  on MobaXterm via ssh to `dr1edge01` and changed user to `PRODREST` using sudo.
7. Check the logs of failed script.
```
less /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log
...
WARNING: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Row length 34XXX is > 32767
```

8. After investigation this error indicates that the key column for the HBase table is greater than the limit, so the insert fails.
9. Find how many lines are causing this error by executing the `SELECT` part of the query and adding `WHERE length(...)>32767` at the end:
```
SELECT
        concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id),
        'true',
        'true',
        originate_timestamp,
        ...
ON a.service_name = b.name
WHERE b.show_customer=TRUE
       AND length(concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id))>32767;
```

This query returned 1 row. Copy the above query into a file for future reference.

10. Copy script `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`.

11. Edit the copy. Append `AND length(concat(default.hbase_salt_md5hex(client_username,4,TRUE), chr(0), hex(CAST(CAST(u_timestamp AS DOUBLE) * 1000000 AS bigint)), chr(0), a.id))<32767` at the end of the query.

11. Execute the new script. Check the execution is successful.
```
/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh.pqr `date -d '-1 day' '+%Y%m%d'`  >> /var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log 2>&1
```

12. In the Grafana charts, check that stage is green now.
