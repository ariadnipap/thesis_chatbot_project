# mno - BigStreamer - IM1805149 - IBank_Ingetion batch job failed

<b>Description:</b>

```
Today 1/3/2022 we have the following Failed Batch Job at Grafana monitoring tool.

application: IBank_Ingestion
job_name: MergeBatch
component: Job
Status: Failed
Host: dr1edge01.mno.gr
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox
2. At the YARN UI search for `PRODREST` and sort by End date. You will find the failed application.
3. From the UI we saw that Spark exited due to OOM errors.
4. Using this [document] (KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#merge-batch) we executed Merge Batch in 3 steps in parallel:
    ```
    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh "2022-02-28 00:00:00" "2022-02-28 12:00:00"
    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh "2022-02-28 12:00:00" "2022-02-28 18:00:00"
    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_batch_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh "2022-02-28 18:00:00" "2022-01-03 00:00:00"
    ```
5. We updated the monitoring postgres database in order for the entry to appear green in Grafana. You can get a success query for Merge batch from the log file of the master script and change the dates. To check it worker Grafana must so no failed merge batch jobs for that day.
6. We created a copy of the master script as `PRODREST` at `dr1edge01`.
7. Inside the copy script we erased the steps before the [Distinct join to Service Audit](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ibank.md#distinct-join-to-service-audit) stage.
8. We executed the copy script and performed checks as ndefd in the support document.
