# mno - BigStreamer - SD1951890 - hdfs - Data Directory Status

<b>Description:</b>

```
Good evening,

Today 20/6/2022 at 12:40 pm the following message appeared in the cloudera system for dr1edge01:

hdfs - DataNode(dr1node07) - Data Directory Status - Warning
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

After investigation we saw that the problem occurred due to disk issue on dr1node07.

We communicated with Oracle and disk replacement was scheduled.

> Ndef that disk replacement perfomerd online so there was no downtime.

According with to [this document](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=134521948780510&parent=EXTERNAL_SEARCH&sourceId=REFERENCE&id=2642582.1&_afrvwxowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=150blaep6z_4) we perfomed the following steps. Feel free to read it extensively.



1. Before proceed with the following procedure make sure that the partition is not used from any process with the following command:
```bash
lsof /u09
```
If you get an active process you should stop it first and start it again after step 7.

For example, if there are processes running on YARN Node Manager then proceed with following the steps [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/issues/208) about stopping impala daemon & YARN roles on the corresponding node, in more detail:

- Connect from the corresponding drnode with `impala-shell -i dr1edge.mno.gr -k --ssl`
- Give permissions from inside impala-shell to your user with `grant role icom_adm to group EXXXXX`
- Run `:SHUTDOWN('FQDN')` from inside impala-shell

2. Back up `efis1entry`:
```bash
ls -l /opt/oracle/bda/compmon/efis1entry
mv /opt/oracle/bda/compmon/efis1entry /opt/oracle/bda/compmon/efis1entry.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`
```
3. Download "45R.zip" from above doc and and place in a temporary/staging location on the server where the disk will be or was replaced.
4. Extract "bdadiskutility" into /opt/oracle/bda/bin/bdadiskutility and "efis1entry" into /opt/oracle/bda/compmon/efis1entry
```bash
unzip 45R.zip bdadiskutility -d /opt/oracle/bda/bin/
unzip 45R.zip efis1entry -d /opt/oracle/bda/compmon/
ls -l /opt/oracle/bda/bin/bdadiskutility #Verify that it is extracted
ls -l /opt/oracle/bda/compmon/efis1entry #Verify that it is extracted
```
5. Set the permissions on both scripts and verify
```bash
chmod 0755 /opt/oracle/bda/bin/bdadiskutility
chmod 0755 /opt/oracle/bda/compmon/efis1entry
ls -l /opt/oracle/bda/bin/bdadiskutility 
ls -l /opt/oracle/bda/compmon/efis1entry 
```
6. Confirm the latest bdadiskutility is in place
```bash
bdadiskutility -v #Must be 45R
```
7. Display a summary of all disk states
```bash
bdadiskutility -i
```
8. After the disk is replaced, and the slot and mount point of the replaced disk fully identified, configure the replaced disk. In our case is u01

```bash
bdadiskutility /u01
```
With force option:

```bash
bdadiskutility -f /u01
```

9. Configure OS disk

>Ndef: Perform this step only if the partition is mirrored. Otherwise skip this step. You can check that by running the following command:

Make sure that you can see `/u09`
```bash
lsblk
```

After successfully configuring an OS disk with bdadiskutility confirm the  mirrored partitions are in an "active sync" state before rebooting the server.

Monitor the state of the  mirrored partitions for the equivalent device paths for "/boot" and "/" on the system.

For example if "/boot" and "/" are /dev/md126 and /dev/md127 respectively, monitor the status with:
```bash
cat /proc/mdstat
mdadm -Q --detail /dev/md126
mdadm -Q --detail /dev/md127
```


*Congrats!* 

Disk replacement is complete
