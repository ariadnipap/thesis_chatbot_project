</b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to Cloudera for PR Site 
2. To identify the Impala query from `Upsert to HBase` we can see logs from the script at `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/log/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert.log` as `PRODREST` user. We cite a screenshot that shows the query. Also, we see the url where we can monitor the query progress (paste this url on a firefox opened through terminal), as well as the coordinator.

   > Ndef: These are not logs from that specific script execution, just a sample to see where you can find the query information you need.

3. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` we identified the query and noticed that it had stopped getting processed. In addition, we noticed that Impala had stopped processing other queries as well
4. We cancelled the query that ran for `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` execution. We can cancel the query in two ways.
   1. From `Cloudera > Impala > Queries` you can click `cancel` at the dropdown next to the query
   2. From the url that we monitor the query
5. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node01. This solved the problem with this specific node, however the service did not correspond
6. We restarted Impala daemon role for pr1node04 that was the coordinator for the query. This solved the problem and recovered the service functionality
7. Upon investigation, we concluded that the change to `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` that stops the parallel execution of the query by Impala daemons (set num_nodes = 1) was the cause of the problem
8. We scheduled to rerun the `Upsert to HBase` stage the following day after reverting the script to use all Impala daemons for parallel execution.
9.  On 03/03/2023 
   - we disabled HBase quotas for ` PROD_IBANK` namespace on PR Site according to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/22263_mno_HBASE_TUNING.docx) MoP
   - we removed `set num_nodes = 1` from `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh`
   - reran the script
10. The script ran successfully

<b>Action Points:</b>

1. We opened [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/mno/devops-mno/-/issues/67) issue to investigate and deploy a permanent fix for running `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/ibank_visible_trn_hbase_daily_upsert_STABLE.sh` alongside HBase quotas.

<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>

```
03/03/23 00:49:29 Europe/Eastern (MASTROKOSTA MARIA):
Good evening,

The root cause is the same as ticket SD2158913. The job that populates the visible table was canceled after consultation with the customer as it was affecting the live streams.

The job will be scheduled to be rerun after consultation

Thank you
```
