<b>Description:</b>

On 5/5/2022 we had the following Failed Batch Job at Grafana monitoring tool.

The following batch job failed at Grafana
application: DWH_IBANK
job_name: EXPORT
component: SERVICE_AUDIT
description: Code 1
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to grafana to make sure that the alert is about DR SITE
2. Login to `dr1edge01` and open firefox
3. At the YARN UI search for `PRODUSER`, sort by End date and search with "PROD_IBANK_DWH_EXPORT_ServiceAudit. You will find the failed application.
4. From the UI we noticed that the job with id application_1651064786946_8294 started manually before the completion of the automated job with id application_1651064786946_8190, which led to the failure of the second job.
5. We informed the client that they should rerun the failed job manually from the scheduler after the completion of the manual step. Also, we pointed out that before proceding with manual actions they should make sure beforehand that all scheduled flows have completed.
