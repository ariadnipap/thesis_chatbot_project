# mno - BigStreamer - IM2024442 - Critical alarm in Cloudera Application - dr1edge01

<b>Description:</b>

```bash
Hello

A critical alarm appeared in Cloudera Application in dr1edge01.

Hive --> HiveServer2 (dr1node04) // Pause Duration.

Please for your attention.

Thanks
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Check HiveServer2 JVM Heap Memory Usage and JVM Pause Time Charts from Cloudera Manager.

    ```bash
    cluster -> Hive -> HiveServer2 -> Charts
    ```

2. Restart HiveServer2 Instance if needed (workaround).

    ``` bash
    In our case the service had Unexpected Exits due to OutOfMemory. 
    ```

3. Search for "Java Heap Space" failed Jobs in HiveServer2 Service Logs.

    ```bash
    grep Java /var/log/hive/hadoop-cmf-hive-HIVESERVER2-dr1node 04.mno-gr.log.out
    ```

    Example Output:

4. Check failed Yarn Applications from Cloudera Manager that match those of the previous step.

    ```bash
    Cluster -> Yarn -> Applications -> Filter: "application_type = MAPREDUCE"
    ```

5. Search for GC Pause Duration in HiveServer2 Service Logs and make sure that the warnings started after the submission of the failed jobs.

    ```bash
    grep GC /var/log/hive/hadoop-cmf-hive-HIVESERVER2-dr1node 04.mno-gr.log.out
    ```

6. Compare the timestamps of all the above to be sure that you have found the queries that caused the problem.

<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>

```bash
Good evening,

HiveServer2 of dr1node04 is back up. Services and flows have been checked and there is no problem at this time.

We appreciate your checks and are continuing to analyze the root cause.

Thank you
```

```bash
Good evening,

The following findings emerged from the analysis:

HiveServer2 of dr1node04 crashed from OutOfMemory, because the Java Heap Space was full.
The Pause Duration messages in Cloudera Manager are related to the Garbage Collector delay.

Specifically, from the analysis of the logs we saw that between 14:19 and 15:24, HiveServer2 of dr1node04 was called to manage 8 Queries which crashed with a Java Heap Space error. The GC started throwing warnings from 15:08, as it could not clean the memory of the above. The service crashed with an OutOfMemory error, restarted and returned to normal operation.

Below are details for the specific queries:

All queries are for the table: dev_trlog_card.pmnt_response_stg_0.

Please confirm that we can proceed to close the ticket.
