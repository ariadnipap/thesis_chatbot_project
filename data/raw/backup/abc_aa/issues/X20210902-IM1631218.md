# abc - IM1631218 - huawei tv  

<b>Description:</b>

```
Good morning, please load the tables huawei_tv.rel_play_tv_hist, huawei_tv.rel_play_tvod_hist, huawei_tv.rel_play_vod_hist for 31/8-1/9 and huawei_tv.rel_vod_info_hist for 1/9 with data.
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to Hue and go to `Editor` > `Impala`
2. Check for missing partitions as stated in description
```bash
select count(*), par_dt 
from huawei_tv.rel_vod_info_hist  
where par_dt between '20210825' and '20210905' 
group by par_dt 
order by par_dt;
Result:
count(*)	par_dt	
...
15026	20210830	
14728	20210901	
14748	20210902	
...
```

3. Partition for `20210831` is actually missing but `20210901` is here and seems fine.

4. Check logs of flow but first login to `un2`. And yes, huawei tv loads data for yesterday's partition from today's table #crazyright

``` bash
$ su - intra
$ cd /shared/abc/huawei_tv/
$ less log/huawei_tv_load.20210901.log
...

sftp> get export/20210901/*.csv /data/1/huawei_tv_LZ/

Fetching /export/20210901/REL_VOD_INFO.csv to /data/1/huawei_tv_LZ/REL_VOD_INFO.csv

```

5. Let's inspect those files
```bash
$ sftp bigdata@172.28.128.150:/export
sftp> cd 20210901
sftp> ls -l
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0          476541 Sep  1 05:13 EPG_SCHEDULE.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0               0 Sep  1 05:11 REL_PLAY_TV.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0               0 Sep  1 05:10 REL_PLAY_TVOD.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0               0 Sep  1 05:11 REL_PLAY_VOD.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0         3470903 Sep  1 05:11 REL_VOD_INFO.csv
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0        11414886 Sep  1 05:13 SubscriberID_STBMACAddress_Relationship.csv
```
As it is obvious, there are empty files, so abc needs to reload data into the remfgh server and we need to run the script for the missing partition:
```bash
$ /shared/abc/huawei_tv/bin/huawei_tv_load.sh 20210831
```


<b>Affected Systems:</b>

abc Bigstreamer

<b>Action Points:</b>

We have informed abc about each case and wait for their response.
Partition `20210901` is fine but `20210831` needs manual action as nfghd in step 5.
