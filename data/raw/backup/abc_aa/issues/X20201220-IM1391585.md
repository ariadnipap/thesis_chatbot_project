<b>Description:</b>

```
Good morning,

Please check immediately if BigStreamer is working properly.

We have received many alerts over the weekend and today regarding HDFS, for various nodes as well as for services (eg oozie). We also noticed problems with geolocation streams and loc mob files.

Thanks,

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Connect with personal creds `https://172.25.37.232:7183` Cloudera Manager
2. Namenodes were both on standby mode which caused bad health on HDFS,HBASE,OOZIE,IMPALA. After nn1 restarted nn2 became the Active and nn1 the Standby namenode. All the other services was stable after this manual action except HBASE which restarted.
3. Since all services were stable check HUE `https://172.25.37.236:8888/oozie/list_oozie_workflows/` to ensure that all workflows running.
