# abc - BigStreamer - IM1793457 - SM - Missing Data 14022022

<b>Description:</b>

Good morning,

We have been informed about an alarm that exists in the SM system. There seems to be missing metrics for Piraeus in the PE_BRNCH_QoS file.

Please for your checks.

Thanks

<b>Customer Update:</b>

Good evening,

As an example, we send 2 cases below.

PE_BRANCH_QoS received by SM for 5min 15:20 seems to be missing metrics in each QoS
PB-2084-ce.piraeusbank.customers.fghnet.gr

SM-MISSING DATA 14022022_1.png

PB-2600-ce.piraeusbank.customers.fghnet.gr

SM-MISSING DATA 14022022_2.png

Accordingly in the file received by SM for 5 minutes 00:20 there were measurements.

Thanks

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Check the metrics in the output file

```bash
[root@un2]# less /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/custompoller/PE_BRNCH_QoS_2022-02-15_15.20.00.csv | grep "piraeusbank.customers.fghnet.gr||"
[root@un2]# less /shared/abc/ip_vpn/out/custompoller/PE_BRNCH_QoS_2022-02-15_15.20.00.csv | grep "PB-2600-ce.piraeusbank.customers.fghnet.gr"
```

2. Input files are loaded into Hive table: bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist\
Check the metrics for several files and compare them

```bash
#From Hue
select * from bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist where n5_minute='2022-02-15 00:20:00' and site_code='PB-2600';
select * from bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist where n5_minute='2022-02-15 15:20:00' and site_code='PB-2600';
```

The format of the PE_BRNCH_QoS_<yyyy-mm-dd_HH.MM.SS>.csv is the following:

```
n5_minute|network_element_name|rttd|pl12|jitter||pl3||300
```

4. Ckeck the implementation for each metric\
eg rttd:

Check the formula from file: https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/docs/19025_abc%20VPN%20Customers%20SLA%20@%20BigStreamer%20User%20and%20Administrator%20Guide%20v2.3.docx

```
rttd = sumofrtt / numofrtt
```

If <b>numofrtt</b> is 0 or NULL check the query implementaion in the file: /shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/compute_qos_kpis.sh

In our case numofrtt is 0, so the implementation puts the character:"" in the output file.

```bash
...
case when rank=1 then if(NONNULLVALUE(r.numofrtt) && NONNULLVALUE(r.sumofrtt) && r.Numofrtt!=0 , cast(cast(r.SumOfRTT/r.NumOfRTT AS DECIMAL(20,1)) AS STRING),'')
                        else ''
                        end as rttd,
                        '' as pl3
...
```

<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>

Good morning,

after investigation we saw that for the specific measurements the implementation throws a blank in the cases where the denominator of the formula is zero.

Checked the readings we got from the probe and saw that the ones used as the denominator are zero resulting in a gap in the readings you are seeing.
