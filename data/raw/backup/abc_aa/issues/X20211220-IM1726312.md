<b>Actions Taken:</b>

Procedure:
-------------
```
Get info about flow from "trn" file:

more unc2:/shared/abc/traffica/DataParser_voice_quality/scripts/transferlist/01_traffica_voice_quality.trn

 - files incomming directly from fgh
 - under  spool_area="/data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica"
 - file_type="TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc*"
 - suffix=".dat"
 - load_suffix="LOADED"
nfgh: all files with the ".LOADED" extention , have been successfully processed.
check only for ".dat" files without the ".LOADED" extention , to see if something was wrong.
```

Verify for previous dates (table only has data for 7 days):
--------------------------------------------------------------
```
select par_dt, count(*) cnt from sai.voice_quality_hist group by 1 order by 1;
par_dt   | cnt     
---------+---------
20211122 | 24175236   <-- normal rows
20211123 | 21502579
20211124 | 17456051
20211125 | 18409272
20211126 | 18729343
20211127 | 14049150
20211128 | 10861604   <-- fewer rows
20211129 | 17729519
20211130 | 19021196
20211201 |  9955414   <-- not completed yet (today)
```

Then compare files from day with problem , eg:
--------------------------------------------------
```
[root@unc2 ~]# ll /data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica/TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc_TRAVQTNES_20211128* | wc -l 
4658
and comrare with a good one :
[root@unc2 ~]# ll /data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica/TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc_TRAVQTNES_20211121* | wc -l
5764
```

also compare rows contained in above files:
---------------------------------------------
```
[intra@unc2 Traffica]$ cat /data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica/TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc_TRAVQTNES_20211128* | wc -l
11155058
[intra@unc2 Traffica]$ cat /data/1/trafficaftp/Traffica/TrafRTTE_Voice_Quality_abc_TRAVQTNES_20211121* | wc -l 
16411173
```

So, 
------
fgh has sent fewer files ( we have no control on this)!
