# mno - BigStreamer - IM1769421 - Πρόβλημα χρήστη σε queries

<b>Description:</b>

```
We notice that the user with E70529 cannot make queries in Hue either via impala-shell, while he has the permissions and was playing until Friday at noon.
There was no user group in the user management of hue and when I created it and went to sync it, it crashed.
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to dr1node3 as root and check the groups of E70529 user

`# id E70529 | grep 871556062`
You will notice that the name of the above group is empty.
Lets fix that!

Ndef1: This occurs for dr1node03, dr1node05, dr1node06, dr1node07,dr1node08,dr1node09,dr1node10

Ndef2: Perform the above actions for all nodes

2. `# sss_cache -E;id E70529 | grep 871556062`

Now you must be able to see the name of the group. If not, continue with the following steps in order to clear cache and restart sssd with the right name of the group:

1.  `# dcli -c dr1node03, dr1node05, dr1node06, dr1node07,dr1node08,dr1node09.dr1node10  'mv /var/lib/sss/db/* /tmp;systemctl restart sssd'`

2.  `# dcli -C 'id E70529 | grep -v "CMS Way4Manager PROD RDS DevTOOLS"'`

3.  `# dcli -C 'id E70529 | grep -v "CMS Way4Manager PROD RDS DevTOOLS"' | wc -l`
