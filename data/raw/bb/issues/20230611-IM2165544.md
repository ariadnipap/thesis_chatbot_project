# mno - BigStreamer - IM2165544 - Alert at Cloudera Manager (DR/PR)

</b>Description:</b>

```
Good evening.
The following alert appeared in Cloudera Manager (PR) in Hosts:
-pr1edge01.mno.g
-Clock Offset

Thank you.

Following ticket SD2228610, the following alerts also appeared in Hosts for Cloudera Manager DR and PR respectively:
-dr1edge02.mno.gr
-Clock Offset

-pr1edge02.mno.gr
-Clock Offset
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to Cloudera Manager UI for both Sites
2. We did not notice any other issues on either Site after checking services' charts and did not have any other alerts
3. The clock offset relates to the ntpd service, so on the affected nodes (dr1edge02, pr1edge01, pr1edge02) we inspected the service's status
 ```bash
 systemctl status ntpd
 ```
 The service was running
4. We restarted the service on the affected nodes
 ```bash
 systemctl restart ntpd
 ```
5. After a while the alert cleared up
6. We guessed that there were actions at the time servers

Good morning,

We have restarted the ntpd service on dr1edge02, pr1edge01 and pr1edge02 that displayed the clock offset alert. After the restart, the alert cleared.

Has any action been taken on the time servers?

Thank you
