# mno - BigStreamer - IM2165930 - Alert at Grafana

<b>Description:</b>

```
Good evening
The following alert appeared in Grafana:

[DR][ONLINE] Spark Waiting Batches alert

Thank you.
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Login to grafana at https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000 with personal account
2. Inspected Monitoring Alerts and Monitoring DR\PR to confirm which topology has the issue. We saw that the alert line for online topology had no line.
3. SSH to dr1nodeedge01 and open firefox with `firefox` without root privilege.
4. From `Yarn` tab on the browser we ensured that the application had failed
5. Resubmitted topology with `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh` script as `PRODREST` user.
6. From application's logs we concluded it was a kerberos issue.

7. The topology was down from ~8.30 pm on Sunday 11/06 and was resubmitted on Monday 12/06. Therefore the merge batch job for 11/06 had completed with lack of data. The devs' team checked that there were 9 transactions that were interrupted during the failure of the spark job so if we reran the script for merge batch there would be 9 double records in hive.
8. We decided to transfer the prod_trlog_online.service_audit table for par_dt=20230611 from PR to DR Site with distcp according to the procedure described [here](./20201218-IM1389913.md)

Ndef: The data from kudu for the specific partition needed manual deletion on 15/06 by devs and HBase needs no manual action since it clears by CleanupHBaseSAS spark job.

Good evening,

The root cause is the same as in SD2228613.

Let us know if you need anything else, otherwise we will proceed to close the ticket.

Thanks

Good morning,

The topology crashed due to a problem with kerberos as mentioned in SD2228613. It has been resubmitted.

Thanks
```

The client confirmed that the issue with kerberos was because one of the two domain controllers was out due to patching
