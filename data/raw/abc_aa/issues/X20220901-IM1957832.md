<b>Description:</b>

_No alerts from cloudera. We noticed that since yesterday morning, alerts have stopped coming from the cloudera manager.
I sent a test mail (attached) today from the cloudera manager which came normally but the automatic mails we receive every day have stopped._


abc opened the above ticket to our team. 

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

- Ssh to **un5**  Alert Publisher Node and check the following files for error:

```
less /var/log/messages
less /var/log/mail.err 
less /var/log/mail.info 
less /var/log/cloudera-scm-alertpublisher
less mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out
```

- Use the following commands as example to check the above log file in order to count how many alerts are in the logs and you can grep depending on month,date and the message. 
```
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Generated subject [Cloudera Alert]' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'has become bad' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {20..31}; do echo 2022-08-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-08-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'has become bad' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Cloudera Alert' | wc -l;done
for i in {01..05}; do echo 2022-09-$i; cat mgmt-cmf-mgmt-ALERTPUBLISHER-un5.bigdata.abc.gr.log.out | grep 2022-09-${i} | grep 'Collected new alert' | wc -l;done
```

- _Preventively step_ Restart Alert Publisher through Cloudera Manager

- From the above investigation we came up to the result that we did not had a problem **as we did not find any errors** with the email alerting system because it was during a vacation period, so it was clearly that it had less warnings and alerts because of that.
