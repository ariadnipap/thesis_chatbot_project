## Subject: Neighbor Tool - Solvatio interface failure 

Ticket Number: IM2225720

Priority: Critical

Date: 29-09-2023

<b>Description:</b>

```
Good evening,

They informed us that the Solvatio interface with the Neighbor tool does not work.

The password of the user neighbor_user expired, we reset it but when we hit the url https://cne.fgh.gr/bigstreamer-api/rest/neighbourAlgorithm/2109700572 (the fixed one you see is mine and you can use it for testing reasons) returns us:

{"error": "org.springframework.jdbc.CannotGetJdbcConnectionException: Could not get JDBC Connection; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: [Cloudera][ImpalaJDBCDriver](500164) Error initialized or created transport for authentication: [Cloudera][ImpalaJDBCDriver](500592) Authentication failed..", "message": "Could not get JDBC Connection; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: [Cloudera][ImpalaJDBCDriver](500164) Error initialized or created transport for authentication: [Cloudera][ImpalaJDBCDriver](500592) Authentication failed.."}

Please for your checks.

Thanks
```
<b>Investigation:</b>

In order to check the logs of this we did the following:
```
ssh unekl1/unekl2
su - wildfly
bash
```
ckeck logs:
`ekltaillog`

<b>Resolution:</b>

The problem was that the password has expired. So in order to change it after we received a new one from abc was to connect to the following UI :

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

```
https://172.25.37.247:8543/serviceweaver/jmx/
```
[login_info](https://metis.xyztel.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/abc-syspasswd.kdbx?ref_type=heads)

And under `servers -> com.xyz.abc_nts.bigstreamer_api.util -> mbeans -> name=BigStreamerApiJmxConfig -> attributes -> ImpalaURL` we change the password :

```
jdbc:impala://172.25.37.237:21090;SSL=1;AuthMech=3;UID=neighb_user;PWD=HERE_ENTER_PASSWORD;
```

Retrieve the password from the abc Admin or xyz's PM


Then start the wildfly service or restart:

start wildfly:
`ekl-start`


For checks of the api from Haproxy : 
```
https://cne.fgh.gr/bigstreamer-api/rest/neighbourAlgorithm/phone_number_provided_from_abc
```
 
For checks of the API directly from the servers:

```
https://unekl1/bigstreamer-api/rest/neighbourAlgorithm/phone_number_provided_from_abc
https://unekl2/bigstreamer-api/rest/neighbourAlgorithm/phone_number_provided_from_abc
```
