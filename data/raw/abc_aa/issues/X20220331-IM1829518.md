# abc - BigStreamer - IM1829518 -  missing data  aums.archive_data

<b>Description:</b>

```
Good evening,
aums schema archive_data table has not loaded data for 03/30/2022
Thank you
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1.  Login to un2 and change to intra user with `sudo su - intra ` command
2.  Give the following command in order to check the wanted partition

`[intra@un2 ~]$ sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -ls /ez/warehouse/aums.db/archive_data/par_dt=20220330`

You must be able to see the following ouput 
`ls: /ez/warehouse/aums.db/archive_data/par_dt=20220330': No such file or directory `

3.  Connect to impala with `intra` user in order to refresh the table 

` > refresh aums.archive_data;`

4.  Check if you can see the missing data with the following command from impala using `intra` user:

`> show files in aums.archive_data partition (par_dt>='20220329');`


If not then let's check the sftp server. You will notice that files for 31/03/2022 also missing.

5.  From un2: `ssh bigd@172.16.166.30/;`

 ` sftp> ls aums`

You must be able to see the zip files : aems_data_20220329233417.zip and aems_data_20220330233347.zip for 30/03/2022 and 31/03/2022.

6. Lets try to put those file to a local directory, remove them and upload them with the following commands: 

`[intra@un2 data_aums]$ sftp bigd@172.16.166.30`
Connected to 172.16.166.30.

Locally transfer the file for 30/03/2022:

`sftp> get aems_data_20220330233347.zip`

Remove file:

`sftp> rm  aems_data_20220330233347.zip `

Locally transfer the file for 31/03/2022:

`sftp> get aems_data_20220331233417.zip `

Remove file:

`sftp> rm  aems_data_20220331233417.zip `

Now, let's upload those files again:

`sftp> put aems_data_20220330233347.zip`

`sftp> put aems_data_20220331233417.zip `

7. Streamsets won't upload those files simultaneously. You will be able to see first the partition for 30/03/2022 and secondly partition for 31/03/2022.

From impala shell with `intra` user run the following command and make sure you will be able to see the missing partitions

`> show files in aums.archive_data partition (par_dt>='20220330');`

8. Check logs at un2:/shared/sdc/log
