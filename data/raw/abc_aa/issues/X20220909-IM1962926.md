<b>Description:</b>

`RStudio user applications not working We would like to inform you that the applications of the user kmpoletis are not running showing the following error. This morning we reset the user's password because it had expired. It can connect normally with the credentials. Also let me know that the applications of the other users (Charisis, Ploskas) are running normally.`

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

- Ssh to **unrstudio1**

- Do an ldap search using `t1-svc-cnebind` as the following in order to check if `t1-svc-cnebind` password is still valid:

```
ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D "t1-svc-cnebind" -W -b "dc=groupnet,dc=gr" '(sAMAccountName=t1-svc-cnebind)'
```

-  In the above case, if you get an error that you can't connect with the ldap server, that means it has an expired `t1-svc-cnebind` password, so you will need to replace it with a new one.

- Check the configuration file below for the current ldap t1-svc-cnebind password & replace it with new **(Responsible for that abc Admin)**:
```
ssh unrstudio1
vi /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg
```
