# abc - BigStreamer - IM2158478 - HDFS bad health

<b>Description:</b>
```
Good morning,

HDFS status is bad as HDFS Failover Controller role is down on nodes mn1, mn2

Please for your checks.

Thanks
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Since the failover controller roles were down, we investigated their logs under `/var/log/hadoop-hdfs/`
   on each host and found that they received a timeout in their connection to zookeeper leading them to
   shutdown until they were manually restarted.

2. Checking the zookeper server logs under `/var/log/zookeeper/` we observed that they report that the
   connection had been closed client side. Additionally at the same time frame we checked to see if
   there were any issues with other services hosted on these nodes, mainly if any Namenodes had any
   issues, and found none.

3. Similarly from Cloudera Manager we checked the host's event log for any red flags and found none.
   Lastly we didn't find any network errors on both hosts.

4. Through Cloudera Manager health checking we see certain RPC latency alerts popping up with values
   above 1500 ms. Additionally we checked Zookeeper Server's tick time under `ZooKeeper->Configuration->Tick Time`.

4. Thus we concluded that, given the zookeeper's tick time of 2000 ms and no other issues found
, a spike in latency led to the above timeout and after communicating with the customer
we enabled the failover controller's automatic restart to avoid having the failover controllers
down for prolonged periods of time. This was done without needing any services or redeploy any configuration
by checking the box under `HDFS->Failover Controller->Automatically Restart Processes`.
