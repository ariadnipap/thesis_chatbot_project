# abc - IM2352302 - idm2.bigdata.abc.gr Change to Faulty State

<b>Description:</b>

```
Good evening,

idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --> Not Healthy state.
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. After checking the error on Cloudera Manager idm2 was briefly in bad health with error `Swapping`. Checking the graphs for the hosts reported over 
GB (out of 64GB) of physical memory in use.
2. Logged in with SSH and checked memory per process

    ``` bash
    ps aux --sort -rss
    ```

3. The top process consuming memory was `cmf-agent`, which is the Cloudera Manager Agent process. After a quick search we found the following bug [Cloudera bug: OPSAPS-59764: Memory leak in the Cloudera Manager agent while downloading the parcels](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud-base/7.1.8/manager-release-nfghs/topics/cm-known-issues-773.html)
4. To verify that this bug is triggered we checked the parcel page of Cloudera Manager and we found that two hosts (`idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`/`idm2.bigdata.abc.gr`) where constantly trying to download some of the parcels that are distributed, but not available anymore.
5. We proposed to the client to remove the two hosts from the logical cluster, since they did not have any roles.

    ```
    From Cloudera Manager
    Hosts > All Hosts > Check `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` and `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` > Actions > Remove from Cluster
    ```

    ```bash
    systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent
    ```

6. After removing the two hosts from the cluster and restarting the Cloudera Manager Agent memory consumption for the two hosts has remained stable.
