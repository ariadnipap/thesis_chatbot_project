# abc - IM1476278 - CDSW Not enough CPU/GPU/Memory 

<b>Description:</b>

```
Good morning, 

For 2 days now all jobs in CDSW fail (stay in status schedule) with the message
"Unschedulable: No host in the cluster currently has enough CPU, memory and GPU to run the engine"
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Connect with you personal ldap account in 'https://mncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr/'
2. Go to last tab(admin).
3. Select `Activity` tab.
4. Check `CPU` and `Memory` graphs.
5. In our case all scheduled jobs stucked at `Scheduling` due to a job that ran `800 times at 14/03 07:00`
 
- Delete all PENDING pods to free resources

```bash
[root@mncdsw1 ~]# kubectl get pods
[root@mncdsw1 ~]# kubectl get pods | grep Pending | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod --grace-period=0 --force
[root@mncdsw1 ~]# kubectl get pods | grep "Init:0/1" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod --grace-period=0 --force
[root@mncdsw1 ~]# kubectl get pods
```

<b>Affected Systems:</b>

abc Bigstreamer CDSW

<b>Action Points:</b>

If the scheduler cannot find any node where a Pod can fit, the Pod remains unscheduled until a place can be found. However, it will not be killed for excessive CPU usage.

As an action point we could `monitoring compute & memory resource usage` from the Pod status via our monitoring tool.
