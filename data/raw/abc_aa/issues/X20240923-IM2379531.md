<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. After checking logs of `wrkcdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr` `SparkPortForwarder` we saw that the latest request that handled was:

```bash
cdsw status | grep wrkcdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr
kubectl logs spark-port-forwarder-thrr9 -n <namespace>
```

The output of the logs:

```bash
2024-09-21 22:35:16.863 11 INFO SparkPortForwarder Failed to dial onward connection data = {"err":"dial tcp 100.66.1.227:30742: connect: connection refused","name":"spark-driver","podId":"2liofp42ubkcj7yc","port":30742,"target":"100.66.1.227:30742"}
2024-09-22 02:25:23.457 11 INFO SparkPortForwarder Returning port mappping data = {"mapping":{"spark-blockmanager":26577,"spark-driver":22768}}
2024-09-22 02:26:29.689 11 INFO SparkPortForwarder Garbage collecting forwarders for pod data = {"podId":"z48obsz9bocvu2wz"}
```

2. We tried to delete the pod of `wrkcdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr` `SparkPortForwarder` but it stucked on `Terminating` status.

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```

3. Thus, CDSW Application(mncdsw1) from Cloudera UI was down.

4. From [Cloudera Manager UI](https://172.25.37.232:7183/cmf/home) we have restarted the `Docker Deamon Worker` of `wrkcdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr` and `Application` role of `mncdsw1`. After that we have checked the logs and `wrkcdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr` `SparkPortForwarder` handled succefully all the requests

Actions:

```bash
Cloudera Manager -> CDSW -> `Docker Deamon Worker` Role of `wrkcdsw1 -> Restart
Cloudera Manager -> CDSW -> `Application` role of `mncdsw1` -> Restart
```
Logs 

1. Checks:

```bash
cdsw status | grep wrkcdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr
kubectl logs <pod-name-spark-forwarder> -n <namespace>
```

2. Output:

```

5. Additional checks made from the [CDSW UI](https://mncdsw1.bigdata.abc.gr). We reviewed the status of running jobs and examined the logs of them.

```bash
Site Administration -> Usage -> Select job Name -> Logs Tab
```

In the logs of an example job we searched for `SparkPortForwarder` entries for `wrkcdsw1` in order to evaluate that no errors appeared.
