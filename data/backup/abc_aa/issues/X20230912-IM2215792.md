<b>Description:</b>

The following issue has been assigned to our team with subject:

```
Good evening,

Noticed that refdata.rd_cells was not loaded by refdata.rd_cells_load

select max(par_dt) from refdata.rd_cells_load  --> 20230911

select max(refdate) from refdata.rd_cells -->  20230910
```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

At path `/shared/abc/refdata/bin` there is the script `210_refData_Load.sh` that at the beginning of each day loads the reference data at the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table and then updates the table so that this data appears as the latest data for other tables. At the same path there is the script `220_refData_Daily_Snapshot.sh` that loads the reference data from the `refdata.rd_cells_load` table to the `refdata.rd_cells` table, so that the two tables have the latest data recorded. These actions are handled by different server coordinators of cloudera manager. 

We checked the log files for each month at the `/shared/abc/refdata/log` path to see which coordinator was responsible for these processes at September 12. After that we logged in Cloudera Manager, and checked the log files at the specific time interval. We found that due to synchronization issues , the coordinator that updated `refdata.rd_cells` updated it before the procedure that refreshed the data at  `refdata.rd_cells_load` so it read the data from the previous date.

The solution was to add the parameter **set SYNC_DDL=1** at the necessary scripts so there are no synchronization issues.

The logs at cloudera manager are deleted after a certain period of time, so they need to be checked soon after the ticket.
