# abc - BigStreamet - IM2211937 - virtualop ssh error

<b>Description:</b>
```
Good evening,

We notice that on the virtualop node - 172.26.169.11, sometimes we can connect via Cyberark with ssh and other times it shows us the attached error message.

From a first check we did not find anything strange in the ssh configuration. We also restarted the sshd service, but the behavior remains.

Can you check it?

Thanks

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. After confirming the same problem on our end, ie connecting to the host through Cyberark, we login to the
   `admin` server first and then ssh into `virtualop`. We checked the sshd config under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
   for any glaring issues, but as was communicated by the customer, none were found.

2. The next step is to check `/var/log/secure` in order to see if the authentication issue is due to the host
   or if it doesn't even reach it. In there, while performing a test connection, we identified the following
   log entry `refused connect from 10.53.134.71 (10.53.134.71)` which signifies that the host itself refused
   the connection.

3. We check for the existence of `/etc/host.allow` and we added the above address, before testing again.
   The test failed again, this time with a diffrent IP being refused inside `/var/log/secure`, which lead
   us to believe that Cyberark is using multiple IPs and subnets to facilitate connections.

4. We requested all subnets used by Cyberark from the customer in order to add them to `/etc/hosts.allow`
   and after doing so no more connection issues appeared. One thing to nfgh here is that for any new subnets
   that Cyberark will use they must also be added to `/etc/hosts.allow` or the same connection issues will
   reappear.
