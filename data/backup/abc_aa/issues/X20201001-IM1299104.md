Syslog(un2)

Issue Number: IM1299104 
Title: Missing logs

<b>Description:</b>

Good evening, the abc syslog administrators have noticed much lower than expected and irregular log reception times from server 172.25.37.236 for the period 7/23-27.
We would like to investigate the cause and if possible find the missing logs.

Thank you very much for your immediate actions.
