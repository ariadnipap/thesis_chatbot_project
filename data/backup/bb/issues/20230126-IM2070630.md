<b>Actions Taken:</b>

<b>Root Cause Analysis:</b>

Analysis was performed in collaboration with @lmn and @iaravant

1. Check MapReduce logs from YARN UI - App Name: PROD_IBank_DWH_EXPORT_LoanPaymentDetails_*

   ![IM2070630_yarn_app](.media/IM2070630_yarn_app.png)

   ![IM2070630_yarn_mapreduce](.media/IM2070630_yarn_mapreduce.png)

   There was a duplicate entry in prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment_stg.
   Duplicate Key Value: 0E86AF89-F15C-4B78-8925-08ED8D237805

2. Check the tables from Impala Shell with PRODUSER

   ```bash
   [PRODUSER@dr1edge01 ~]$ impala-shell -k -i dr1edge.mno.gr --ssl
   ```

   Check for duplicates in dwh_details_loan_payment_stg and dwh_details_loan_payment with id=0E86AF89-F15C-4B78-8925-08ED8D237805

   ![IM2070630_details_duplicates](.media/IM2070630_details_duplicates.PNG)

   Check service_audit specifically for id=0E86AF89-F15C-4B78-8925-08ED8D237805

   ![IM2070630_service_audit](.media/IM2070630_service_audit.PNG)

   Check service_audit for duplicates

   ![IM2070630_service_audit_monthly](.media/IM2070630_service_audit_monthly.PNG)

   Service_audit contained two entries with the same id=0E86AF89-F15C-4B78-8925-08ED8D237805 and different timestamps.

<b>Resolution:</b>

Solution provided by @fgh and @adrint

```bash
[PRODUSER@dr1edge01 ~]$ impala-shell -k -i dr1edge.mno.gr --ssl
```

```bash
# == DWH LoanPayment ==

# Create table with original data
create table prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.20230126_dwh_details_loan_payment_orig like prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment;

insert into prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.20230126_dwh_details_loan_payment_orig partition(par_dt) select * from prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment where par_dt=20230125;

# Create table and insert only required data
create table prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.20230126_dwh_details_loan_payment_tmp like prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment;

insert into prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.20230126_dwh_details_loan_payment_tmp partition(par_dt) select * from prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment where par_dt = 20230125 and id != '0E86AF89-F15C-4B78-8925-08ED8D237805';

insert into prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.20230126_dwh_details_loan_payment_tmp partition(par_dt) select * from prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment where par_dt = 20230125 and id = '0E86AF89-F15C-4B78-8925-08ED8D237805' and tr_timestamp = '202301025 09:38:13.072489000' limit 1;

# Overwrite normal table with correct data
insert overwrite prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.dwh_details_loan_payment partition(par_dt) select * from prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.20230126_dwh_details_loan_payment_tmp where par_dt = 20230125;
```

```bash
# Run Export procedure 
/opt/ingestion/PRODUSER/datawarehouse-ibank/export_to_dwh/sched_export_to_dwh.sh -t loanPayment
```

```bash
[PRODUSER@dr1edge01 ~]$ impala-shell -k -i dr1edge.mno.gr --ssl
```

```bash
# Drop temporary table
drop prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.20230126_dwh_details_loan_payment_tmp purge

# TODO Check data and drop backup table with initial orginal data
drop prod_trlog_ibank_analytical.20230126_dwh_details_loan_payment_orig purge
```

<b>Our Ticket Response:</b>

```bash
Good evening,

After investigation, it was determined that there is a problem with two different transactions that occurred on 25/01/2023 which were declared with the same id.

The external SQL server LoanPaymentDetails restricts the id field to be UNIQUE, hence the expected error displayed by sqoop-export.

SQLException: Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_LoanPaymentDetails'.
Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'srcib.LoanPaymentDetails'.
The duplicate key value is (0e86af89-f15c-4b78-8925-08ed8d237805)

The id of the problematic transaction is 0E86AF89-F15C-4B78-8925-08ED8D237805 and the first transaction has a timestamp of 09:38:13.072489000 while the second one has a timestamp of 2023-01-25 2023-01-25 09:38:13.476066000.

We suggest deleting one of the two transactions so that we can proceed with the export of the loan payment data for the remaining transactions. The information for both transactions remains in the big data environment
so it can be retrieved if needed later.

Please let us know if you agree to proceed with the proposed action.

Thank you
```

```bash
After communication via email, we proceeded to reconstruct the table, keeping only the record with timestamp 09:38:13.072489000 and reran the job. Please, investigate this on your part and take the necessary actions so that duplicate records are not sent to us. Please confirm that the data is in the SQLServer so that we can close the ticket.
```
