# mno - BigStreamer - IM2072206 - Batch Job Failed

<b>Description:</b>

```bash
Hello,

A failed batch job appeared in Grafana today 27/01/23.

Application: DWH_IBank
Job Name: EXTRACT
Component: MY BANK
Status: Failed
Description: Code 6

Please for your actions.

Thank you.
```

<b>Root Cause Analysis:</b>

1. Login to `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:3000` with personal account and confirm that Datawarehouse Flow failed from `Monitoring/Monitoring PR/DR` dashboard.

   The flow failed with `Code: 6` which means that the control script has timed-out while monitoring the `EXTRACT` script.

2. Check logs

    From `dr1edge01.mno.gr` with personal account:

    ``` bash
    less /var/log/datawarehouse-ibank/PRODUSER/sched_extract.log
    ```

    ![IM2072206_extract_logs](.media/IM2072206_extract_logs.png)

    The monitoring database was updated with status FAILED due to `Check if app is running` timeout.

3. Check the Spark application status from YARN UI

   ![IM2072206_yarn_app](.media/IM2072206_yarn_app.png)

   Spark App Status: SUCCEEDED.

   The script waited for only 1,5min and updated the monitoring database with Failed Status. Spark app began its execution after almost 2,5 minutes.
   > 2,5min is not considered as a noticeable or abnormal delay time, so we did not investigate further.

4. Customer reran the job

5. Check logs and YARN UI of second application

   ![IM2072206_yarn_rerun](.media/IM2072206_yarn_rerun.png)

   ![IM2072206_rerun_logs](.media/IM2072206_rerun_logs.png)

   In this case the Spark app started immediately and the script updated the monitoring app with Running Status.
