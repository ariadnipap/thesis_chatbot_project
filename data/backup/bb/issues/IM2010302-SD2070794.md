```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="step-1"></a> 1. Logged in to Cloudera Manager `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:7183` with personal account in order to check the status of the host "dr1edge01.mno.gr".

2. Checked `https://dr1edge01.mno.gr:7183/cmf/hardware/hosts` the host.

3. Continued in Cloudera Manager on host "dr1edge01.mno.gr" and checked the disks.

4. Logged in to "dr1edge01.mno.gr" node with personal account.

&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="step-5"></a> 5. Executed the following command and disk usage check performed on the nodes.
```bash
df -h
```

6. We saw that the usage in "/var" partition was 100%.

7. We proceed to find wich directory has big enough size.
```bash
sudo du -sh /var/*
```
As we noticed "/var/lib/carbon" directory was enormous, up to 199 G. This directory concerns **Graphite** application. <br/>

8. We navigated to /var/lib/carbon/whisper/translog-api/spark
```bash
cd /var/lib/carbon/whisper/translog-api/spark
```

In this directory we can delete without any confirmation all the "DEV" directories.

```bash
-bash-4.2$ sudo rm -rf IBank_IngestStream_DEV_mno IBank_MergeBatch_DEV_mno IBank_MergeBatch_DEV_mno_Hourly Online_IngestStream_DEV_mno Online_MergeBatch_DEV_mno Online_MergeBatch_DEV_mno_Hourly
```

9. Disk usage has been checked again as step [5](#step-5).

10. Cloudera Manager has been checked to validate that the bad status host alert has been eliminated as step [1](#step-1).
