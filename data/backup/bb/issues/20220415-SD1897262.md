# mno - BigStreamer - IM1840323 - Πρόβλημα με query details CMert


<b>Description:</b>

```
Good evening,

We notice that in some queries we cannot see the details from cloudera manager > impala > queries while they are in the executing phase.
Example
https://pr1node03.mno.gr:7183/cmf/impala/queryDetails?queryId=e7441b27715b1699%3Ad3527df300000000&serviceName=impala

```

<b>Actions Taken:</b>

1. Check that that the problem truly occurs

- Login to CM DR with your pesonal account and go to `Cloudera Manager > impala > queries`
- Select a query that it on executing phase and click on `Query details`

When we tried to checkup on Impala the querie we couldn't see the "Query details" and the message of every query was "Waiting on Client"


2. As a part of the investigation we created `SR 3-29589386011`

3. Acording to Oracle's suggestion problem occurred due to impala query and session timeout. So we had to set the below values: 

- Login to CM DR with your pesonal account and go to `Cloudera Manager > Hue >  Configuration > Hue Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for hue_safety_valve.in` and set the below values: 

```bash
[impala]
query_timeout_s=60
session_timeout_s=60
close_queries =true

[desktop]
[[auth]]
idle_session_timeout=300
```

4. `Restart` Hue Service

5. From `Cloudera Manager > Impala > Configuration and change below values:
- idle_query_timeout: 1 min
- idle_session_timeout: 1 min

6. `Restart` Impala Service
