        "ground_truth": "To disable root SSH login on all servers, modify the SSH configuration. First, check the current configuration:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'grep \"^PermitRootLogin\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config'\n```\nThen, modify the configuration to disallow root login:\n```bash\nsed -i -e 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\nApply the changes using:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.script salt://disable_root_login.sh\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'service sshd reload'\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To prevent root SSH login on all servers, you can modify the SSH configuration file. \n\n    Specifically, you need to set the \"PermitRootLogin\" option to \"no\". This will prevent root users from logging in via SSH.\n\n    The steps to achieve this are as follows:\n\n    1. Open the SSH configuration file using a text editor like vi. The file is usually located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n    2. Locate the line that starts with \"PermitRootLogin\" and set its value to \"no\".\n    3. Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.\n    4. Restart the SSH service to apply the changes. This can usually be done by running the command \"service ssh restart\" or \"systemctl restart sshd\", depending on your system.\n\n    By following these steps, you should be able to prevent root SSH login on all servers.",

        "chatbot_answer": " The procedure you followed seems to be correct. However, there are a few potential issues that could be causing the problem. \n\n1. **Kafka and Kudu services**: Although it's mentioned that you don't have data in the partition, it's still important to ensure that Kafka and Kudu services are stopped before attempting to mount the decrypted disk.\n\n2. **fstab configuration**: The procedure mentions uncommenting the decrypted mount points on fstab. Ensure that this step has been completed correctly, as an incorrect fstab configuration can prevent the disk from mounting.\n\n3. **Mount command**: After updating the fstab configuration, ensure that you have run the `mount -a` command to apply the changes and mount the disk.\n\nIf you've verified all of these potential issues and the problem persists, it may be helpful to provide more detailed information about your environment and the specific steps you've taken so far. \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -a\n```\n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\nmount -a\n``` \n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\nmount -a\n``` \n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\nmount -a\n``` \n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\nmount -a\n``` \n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\nmount -a\n``` \n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\nmount -a\n``` \n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\nmount -a\n``` \n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\n```bash\nmount -l\n``` \n```bash\nmount -a\n``` \n```bash\ntar -xvf /backup/data_1.tar.gz -C /data/1\n``` \n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n``` \n```bash\n",

The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n- **File:** `temip.properties`\n**Alerts:**\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour.

Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n1.

Configure the internal DNS server to resolve the hostnames of the Kafka brokers to their corresponding IP addresses.\n3. Verify that the internal DNS server is resolving the hostnames of the Kafka brokers correctly.\n\n    For example, if the hostname of a Kafka broker is `geolightgr35.geo.abc.gr`, you need to configure the internal DNS server to resolve this hostname to the IP address of the Kafka broker, such as `999.999.999.999`.\n\n    I hope this helps!
