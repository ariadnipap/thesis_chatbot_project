If one of `Slave_IO_Running` or `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`, then the replication is broken\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n6. Start trcpe and check status\n```bash\ntrcpe-start\ntrcpe-status\n```\n7. Login to https://999.999.999.999:8743/rcpe/ with user and shared credentials. You must be able to see the newly created domain.\n### Move users to the created domain\n1. Back up mysql SSO_USERS table:\n```bash\nmysqldump -u root  -p test_r_cpe SSO_USERS --single-transaction > /tmp/SSO_USERS_BACKUP.sql\n```\n2. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\n```\n3. After succesfully restoration on **Slave Mysql Host** start slave:\n      ``` bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n      - No error should exist on `Last_Error`\n      - If no error appeared then `START SLAVE`\n      ```bash\n      START SLAVE;\n      ```\n\t  \n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n## Setup\n### Mysql Instances\n#### PR\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n# Manage IDM Replication\n[TOC]\n## Setup\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/configuration/ServiceWeaver/beanconfig/`\n**Application Logs**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/log/server.log`\n**Access Log**: `/opt/trustcenter/wf_cdef_trc/standalone/log/access_log.log`\n##### MySQL\nMySQL is the database used for the UI. Apart from other things, configuration data managed by users are stored there.\n**MySQL Servers**: `db01.bigdata.abc.gr` and `db02.bigdata.abc.gr` with vIP `999.999.999.999`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n#### DR\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `dr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `dr1node02.mno.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\t- Both Slave_IO_Running and Slave_SQL_Running are set to `Yes` now. And the replication is running without any error.\n\t- `Seconds_Behind_Master` should be 0 after some minutes",

However, if there's no data in the partition, it suggests that stopping these services might not be necessary.\n\nDespite the thoroughness of the response, it could be improved by being more concise while still covering all essential points. The current response is quite lengthy and repetitive, which might make it less engaging or harder to follow for some readers.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 4**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Feedback:** I gave this score because the chatbot's response is mostly relevant and directly addresses the query with detailed instructions.

However, there are a few potential issues that could be causing the problem. \n\n1. **Kafka and Kudu services**: Although it's mentioned that you don't have data in the partition, it's still important to ensure that Kafka and Kudu services are stopped before attempting to mount the decrypted disk.\n\n2. **fstab configuration**: The procedure mentions uncommenting the decrypted mount points on fstab. However, it's possible that the fstab configuration is not correct or has been modified incorrectly.\n\n3. **Mountpoint removal**: The procedure includes removing the /data/1 mountpoint that is no longer in use. However, if this step was not performed correctly, it could potentially cause issues with mounting the decrypted disk.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue, I would recommend checking the system logs for any error messages related to the mounting process.

        "ground_truth": "The memory leak issue in Cloudera Manager is associated with the Cloudera Manager Agent process (`cmf-agent`). To troubleshoot, log in to the affected node and check memory usage with `ps aux --sort -rss`. If `cmf-agent` is consuming excessive memory, verify if the node is stuck downloading parcels. If so, remove the host from the cluster using Cloudera Manager (`Hosts > All Hosts > Actions > Remove from Cluster`). Finally, restart the agent with `systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent` to stabilize memory usage.",

        "chatbot_answer": " To check HBase table quotas, you can use the `list_quotas` command in the HBase shell. This will display a list of all quotas currently set on the HBase cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this command:\n```bash\nhbase shell\nlist_quotas\n```\nThis will output a list of quotas, including the namespace, table name, and quota type (e.g. read, write, etc.). \n\nYou can also check quotas for a specific namespace or table by using the `set_quota` command with the `-namespace` or `-table` option.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\nhbase shell\nset_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\nlist_quotas\n```\nThis will set a quota of 20 requests per second on the `quotas_test` namespace, and then list all quotas currently set on the cluster. \n\nNote that you need to have the necessary permissions and access rights to view and manage HBase quotas. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that quotas are used to limit the amount of resources (e.g. read/write operations, memory, etc.) that can be used by a specific namespace, table, or user. Quotas can help prevent overloading and resource starvation, and can also be used to enforce security policies and access controls. \n\nTherefore, it's essential to carefully plan, configure, and monitor HBase quotas to ensure they are effective in achieving their intended purposes. \n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance. \n\nPlease note that the provided information is based on the context and might not be applicable in all scenarios. \n\nIt's always a good idea to consult the official HBase documentation and seek guidance from experienced professionals if you're unsure about any aspect of HBase quotas or performance testing. \n\nI hope this helps!

        "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot response is directly related to the query about checking HBase table quotas. The response provides a clear and step-by-step guide on how to check these quotas using the `list_quotas` command in the HBase shell.\n\nFurthermore, the response includes examples of how to use this command, which enhances its clarity and usefulness. Additionally, the chatbot provides extra information about setting quotas for specific namespaces or tables, which demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the response is quite lengthy and repetitive in some parts. This might make it slightly overwhelming or difficult to follow for some users. Nonetheless, the overall quality and relevance of the response are excellent.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 5**\n\nThis score reflects the chatbot's ability to provide a clear, step-by-step guide that directly answers the user's query about checking HBase table quotas. The comprehensive nature of the response, including examples and additional relevant information, further justifies this perfect score.

While the retrieved context provides information on setting and removing quotas, it does not directly address the question of checking existing quotas.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 3**\n\n**Feedback:** I gave this score because while the retrieved context is somewhat relevant to the topic of HBase quotas, it does not directly answer the specific question of how to check existing table quotas. The information provided is more focused on setting and removing quotas rather than checking or verifying existing quotas. Therefore, while there is some relevance, the context does not fully meet the requirements of the query.",

The response includes a step-by-step guide on how to use the `list_quotas` command in the HBase shell.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the chatbot's response is overly verbose and repetitive. The response includes numerous instances of identical or similar sentences, which can make it difficult for the reader to discern the most important information.\n\nFurthermore, while the chatbot's response provides a clear explanation of how to check HBase table quotas, it does not provide any additional context or information that might be relevant to the user's query. For example, the response does not discuss the importance of monitoring HBase table quotas, or provide any guidance on how to interpret the results of the `list_quotas` command.\n\nIn light of these observations, I would give the chatbot's response a score of 4 out of 5.

        "chatbot_answer": " To check the number of entries in `sai.voice_quality_hist` over the last 7 days, you can use an Impala query. The exact query would depend on the structure of your table and how dates are stored. However, a basic example to get the count of rows for each day over the last week could look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    date_trunc('day', timestamp_column) AS day,\n    COUNT(*) as num_entries\nFROM \n    sai.voice_quality_hist\nWHERE \n    timestamp_column >= now() - interval '7 days'\nGROUP BY \n    day\nORDER BY \n    day DESC;\n```\n\nThis query assumes you have a `timestamp_column` in your table that stores the date and time of each entry. The `date_trunc('day', timestamp_column)` function is used to truncate the timestamp to the day level, so entries from the same day are grouped together.\n\nPlease adjust the column names and the logic according to your actual schema and requirements. \n\nAlso, ensure you have the necessary permissions to query the Impala tables. \n\nIf you encounter any issues or need further assistance with crafting the query or troubleshooting, feel free to ask!",

There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files\n*Connect to Impala (see [Database CLI commands](#database-cli-commands))*  \n```\nselect * from (\n  select distinct  'activity' tbl, upd_ts from def_network_map.activity union all\n  select distinct  'affected_customers', upd_ts from def_network_map.affected_customers union all\n  select distinct  'affected_oct_wtt', upd_ts from def_network_map.affected_oct_wtt union all\n  select distinct  'defective_netw_element', upd_ts from def_network_map.defective_netw_element union all\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n**MySQL Servers**: `db01.bigdata.abc.gr` and `db02.bigdata.abc.gr` with vIP `999.999.999.999`\n**MySQL Schema**: `trustcenter`\n#### Data Synchronization\nSynchronization of MySQL and BigStreamer's data is done using Sqoop. These are data necessary for computation of the output performance metrics from MySQL used for UI to BigStreamer. Also steps to load configuration tables are done for improving query performance. The master scripts executes jobs in order to update the following Impala tables.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails.
