If you have any further questions or need assistance with a different topic, please feel free to ask. \n\nHowever, in general, to check if a node is online and responsive, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Ping the node: You can use the `ping` command to check if the node is reachable.\n2. Check the node's status: Depending on the type of node and its configuration, you may be able to check its status using a command or a web interface.\n3. Try to connect to the node: If the node provides a service or an interface that you can connect to, try to do so to see if the node is responsive.\n\nPlease note that these are general steps and may not apply specifically to your situation. If you have any further questions or need more specific guidance, please feel free to ask. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the context provided does not mention anything about an \"mn3 node\". It talks about Online Backend Servers, Load Balancer - Netscaler, and Wildfly instances, but it does not provide any information about a specific node called \"mn3\". If you have any further questions or need more specific guidance, please feel free to ask. \n\nIn summary, the context provided does not contain enough information to answer your question about how to check if the mn3 node is online and responsive.

This guide is for MySQL.\n### Glossary\n- MYSQL replication: It is a process that enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to copied automatically to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)\n## Setup\n### Mysql Instances\n#### PR\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n## Procedure\n### Identify the problem\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n      ```\n2. If one of `Slave_IO_Running` or `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`, then the replication is broken\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n6. Start trcpe and check status\n```bash\ntrcpe-start\ntrcpe-status\n```\n7. Login to https://999.999.999.999:8743/rcpe/ with user and shared credentials. You must be able to see the newly created domain.\n### Move users to the created domain\n1. Back up mysql SSO_USERS table:\n```bash\nmysqldump -u root  -p test_r_cpe SSO_USERS --single-transaction > /tmp/SSO_USERS_BACKUP.sql\n```\n2. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\n```\n3. After succesfully restoration on **Slave Mysql Host** start slave:\n      ``` bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n      - No error should exist on `Last_Error`\n      - If no error appeared then `START SLAVE`\n      ```bash\n      START SLAVE;\n      ```\n\t  \n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n## Setup\n### Mysql Instances\n#### PR\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n**User**: `mysql`\n**Port**: `3306`\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n# Manage IDM Replication\n[TOC]\n## Setup\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs).

The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

However, the provided solution is overly complicated and includes unnecessary code snippets.\n\nA more accurate and straightforward approach would involve checking the logs for SparkPortForwarder using `kubectl logs spark-port-forwarder-<pod-name> -n <namespace>`. If errors like 'connection refused' appear, try deleting the failing pod using `kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>`. If it remains in a 'Terminating' state, restart the Docker Daemon Worker from Cloudera Manager (`Cloudera Manager -> CDSW -> Docker Daemon Worker -> Restart`) and restart the CDSW application (`Cloudera Manager -> CDSW -> Application Role -> Restart`). Verify that SparkPortForwarder is operational by checking logs with `kubectl logs <spark-forwarder-pod> -n <namespace>` and confirming successful port forwarding entries.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 2\n\nThe chatbot response attempts to address the issue but provides an overly complicated solution. The correct approach involves checking logs, deleting failing pods, restarting Docker Daemon Worker and CDSW application, and verifying SparkPortForwarder operation. Therefore, a score of 2 is assigned, indicating that the response contains major factual errors.```python\n```import os\nimport sys\n\n# Define a function to restart CDSW services\ndef restart_cdsww_services():\n    #

        "chatbot_answer": " The common reasons for an HBase region server to restart unexpectedly are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the troubleshooting steps and error messages mentioned, it can be inferred that issues related to HBase merging/splitting, Impala/Kudu/HBase performance problems, and YARN killing executors due to memory limits could potentially cause an HBase region server to restart unexpectedly. \n\n    To further troubleshoot the issue, it is recommended to check the HBase region server logs, as well as the application logs, for any error messages or exceptions that may indicate the root cause of the issue. Additionally, monitoring the performance of the HBase cluster, including metrics such as region server memory usage, CPU utilization, and request latency, can help identify potential bottlenecks or issues that may be contributing to the region server restarts. \n\n    By following these troubleshooting steps and monitoring the performance of the HBase cluster, it should be possible to identify and resolve the root cause of the HBase region server restarts. \n\n    It is also recommended to review the HBase configuration files, such as hbase-site.xml and hbase-env.sh, to ensure that the configuration settings are optimal for the specific use case and workload. \n\n    Additionally, it may be helpful to enable debug logging for the HBase region servers, which can provide more detailed information about the internal workings of the region servers and can help identify potential issues or bottlenecks. \n\n    By following these steps and recommendations, it should be possible to troubleshoot and resolve the issue with the HBase region server restarts. \n\n    If the issue persists after trying these troubleshooting steps and recommendations, it may be necessary to seek additional assistance from a qualified HBase administrator or developer who can provide more in-depth guidance and support. \n\n    In any case, it is recommended to continue monitoring the performance of the HBase cluster and to be prepared to take prompt action if any further issues or problems arise. \n\n    By being proactive and taking a thorough and methodical approach to troubleshooting and resolving issues with the HBase region server restarts, it should be possible to minimize downtime and ensure the overall reliability and performance of the HBase cluster. \n\n    In conclusion, the common reasons for an HBase region server to restart unexpectedly are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but based on the troubleshooting steps and error messages mentioned, it can be inferred that issues related to HBase merging/splitting, Impala/Kudu/HBase performance problems, and YARN killing executors due to memory limits could potentially cause an HBase region server to restart unexpectedly. \n\n    To troubleshoot and resolve the issue, it is recommended to follow a thorough and methodical approach, including checking the HBase region server logs, monitoring the performance of the HBase cluster, reviewing the HBase configuration files, enabling debug logging for the HBase region servers, and seeking additional assistance from a qualified HBase administrator or developer if necessary. \n\n    By being proactive and taking a thorough and methodical approach to troubleshooting and resolving issues with the HBase region server restarts, it should be possible to minimize downtime and ensure the overall reliability and performance of the HBase cluster. \n```",

Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=0                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:04:51.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | FAILED  | com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.AppEmptyQueryException | 2023-05-10 07:05:02.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=1                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:05:22.000 |\n#### Inspect specific metric request\nIn case of alerts, we should first check the status of the particular requests on the monitoring DB.\nUsing the metric category and the reference interval associated with a request to IPVPN-SM App we can query the Monitoring DB\nby passing the corresponding job and operative_partition values.\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation.
