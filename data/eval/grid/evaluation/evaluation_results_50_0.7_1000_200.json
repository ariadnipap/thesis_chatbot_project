The context appears to describe a network setup for online services, including load balancers and backend servers, but does not mention how to check if a specific node (like mn3) is online and responsive. Therefore, without more specific details about the mn3 node and its role within this network setup, it's challenging to provide a precise method for checking its status.\n\nIn general, to check if a node is online and responsive, you would typically use tools like `ping` to test connectivity, or more advanced monitoring tools that can check the status of specific services running on the node. However, without knowing the specifics of your setup and what tools are available to you, it's difficult to provide more detailed guidance.\n\nIf you have any additional information about the mn3 node and how it fits into your network setup, I may be able to offer more targeted advice on how to check its status.\n\nFor now, I can only suggest some general steps that might help in checking the status of a node in a network:\n\n1. **Identify the Node's IP Address**: If you know the IP address of the mn3 node, you can use this information to try and connect to it.\n\n2. **Use Ping to Test Connectivity**: The `ping` command is a simple way to test whether a device is reachable over a network. You can try pinging the IP address of the mn3 node to see if you get any response.\n\n3. **Check for Open Ports**: If the ping test fails, it might be because the node is behind a firewall or there are specific rules blocking the traffic.

Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n`insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows.

SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n3.

Just delete the `testuser`.\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3. Check the new user and from the right bar click `delete this entry`\n# For Case 2 follow the below steps:\nIdentify which `kerb` ldap instance has the issue.

Feel free to research them.\n### A brief history of errors\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n**Kerberos Principal Configuration:** `/app/conf/application.yaml` -> `hdfsput.kerberos.principal`\n## Metrics\n| Requirement                         | Metric                          | Metric OID                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\nservice=\"kafka\";\n    };\n    ```\n3.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n## Flows\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1.

Connect to un2 \n``` \nssh un2\nsu - ipvpn\nkinit -kt /home/users/ipvpn/ipvpn.keytab ipvpn\n```\n2. Execute the spark-submit as seen on file `/home/users/ipvpn/run/spark-submit.sh` with the appropriate startMin and endMin parameters\n   e.g. for loading the metrics that correspond to the 5min interval `2023-11-29 11:20:00` :\n```\nspark-submit \\\n  --verbose  \\\n  --master yarn \\\n  --deploy-mode cluster \\\n  --num-executors 4 \\\n  --files /home/users/ipvpn/ipvpn.keytab#ipvpn.keytab,/etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml,/home/users/ipvpn/conf/ipvpn-log4j.xml#ipvpn-log4j.xml \\\n# Failover\n## Scope\nIn case that the active site faces multiple issues that cannot be resolved in a small amount of time, we need to failover applications and procedures to the standby one. \n## Setup\nTwo symmetrical clusters have been setup named production (PR) and disaster (DR). Streaming and batch procedures are running in both sites. External traffic and UC4 flows however are only active in one of them. \n## Procedure\n### Stop streaming procedures\n1. Stop production IBank, Online Spark topologies:\n    - Login with your personal account at `dr1edge01` or `pr1edge01`, based on the site that will be stopped.\n    - Switch user to `PRODREST`.\n    - Comment lines in crontab that run `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/restart_topology_STABLE.sh` and `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/scripts/restart_visible_topology.sh`.\n    - Create `SHUTDOWN` markers for the Spark topologies.\n      \n      ``` bash\n      [PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n```\n- Check from Grafana that the failed job is now succeded\n### Hourly Merge Batch\nEvery hour a  transfers transactions ingested by the [Stream](#stream) flow to an intermediate table and without deleting the data from the original tables.

After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same.

Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```",

If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n## Service Account\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n### User Secret\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n### Backup Procedure\n- From node1 as root:\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n```\n- From edge nodes as root:\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n### Check unsigned certificates\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)",

The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n```  \n  $ curl --location --request GET 'http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:12800/monitoring/app/check'\n  \n  {\"code\":0,\"info\":\"App is up and running.

The error has to do with HBase merging/spliting on a region server, but a detailed reason is unknown.\n# Benchmarking HBASE on Lab with YCSB Tool\n## Introduction\nOur purpose was to run performance tests on a created Hbase table on Lab environment and document the results which will be used as a point of reference to evaluate the efficacy of quotas that will be applied. After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n## Hbase table creation\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n**Alerts**:\n- Retention IbankCleanupHbaseSAS JOB\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n- Use the script logs to identify the cause of the failure\n- After the root cause for the failure is resolved, check on `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/no_bkp/duplicate_cid_hbase` if a manual re-run must be done for a specific date\n  - For a specified date eg 2022-06-30:\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/ingestion/PRODREST/common/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_tools_cleanupHbaseSAS prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_STREAM LIST 20220630\n    ```\n##  Oozie Jobs\n###  Lookup tables\nEvery day (at 07:15 by Oozie on DR & PR site ), we transfers 3 tables with reference data from the legacy MSSQL server, which is managed by mno, to the cluster. We keep only latest version to BigData (no partition).\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Coordinator**: `Coord_IbankLookupTables_PROD`\n**Workflow**: `ImportLookupTables`\n**Local path**: `/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/hdfs_mirror/lookupTables/import_lookup_tables.sh`\n**Logs**: from HUE\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors. You can also try to kill (use Cloudera Manager or yarn command) and then re-submit the topology.\n## Batch\n### Main script\nAs mentioned before, the information processed by the [Prod_Online_IngestStream](#prod_online_ingeststream) topology is stored in Kudu/HBase tables. At the end of each day (at **4:15 am in PR & DR site** by **Cron**) the records from HBase/Kudu is enriched with additional information and the transfered to a parquet table. After the data are inserted to the parquet table, sequent jobs are triggered to produce aggregations and data for external systems. This procedure runs **independantly on both sites**.\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n**Logs**: `/var/log/ingestion/PRODREST/online/log/online_daily_batch_jobs.log`\n- If the alert has exceeded the threshold, investigate HBase/Kudu for delays and check the application logs for any errors. You can also try to kill (use Cloudera Manager or yarn command) and then re-submit the topology.\n#### Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible\n**Visible transaction**: Visible are considered transactions from applications that have show_customer marked as true in the Impala table `prod_trlog_ibank.service_name`.\nThis topology takes **visible** records from the final Kafka topics and writes them to HBase tables. This topology runs independently **on both clusters**.\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Kafka: prod-trlog-ibank-ingest-stream] --> C[Spark: Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible]\n  B[Impala: prod_trlog_ibank.service_name] -->|Queried every 6 hours| C[Spark: Prod_IBANK_IngestStream_Visible]\n  C --> D[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT]\n  C --> E[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_CLUN_APP]\n  C --> F[HBase: PROD_IBANK:SERVICE_AUDIT_IDX_ID]",

We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n```\n#### Check new certificates\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n#### Haproxy certificates\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n**Special caution**:\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n```\nmode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka2 999.999.999.999:9093\nlisten viavi-megafeed-kafka3_ssl\n   bind 999.999.999.999:9093\n   mode tcp\n   balance leastconn\n   server viavi-megafeed-kafka3 999.999.999.999:9093\n```\n## Procedure\n### Manage HAProxy\nStart - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl start haproxy\n```\nStop - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl stop haproxy\n```\nCheck - From incelligent node as root\n``` bash\nsystemctl status haproxy\nss -tulnp | grep 9093 # Check listening port\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check HAProxy IP 3\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 1\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 2\nnc -zv 999.999.999.999 9093 # Check broker 3\n```\n### Manage DNS entries\nLogin to [IDM](https://admin.bigdata.abc.gr/ipa/ui/) with an administrative account to manage DNS entries\nFor example:\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt;

        "chatbot_answer": " To resolve an RStudio user authentication issue after resetting a password, you should first ensure that the time and date on your system are accurate. This is crucial because RStudio Connect uses timestamps to validate user sessions.\n\n     Next, verify that the LDAP authentication settings in RStudio Connect are correctly configured for your organization's LDAP server. This includes ensuring that the Base DN, Bind DN, and Bind Password are all correctly specified.\n\n     If you have recently reset a password for an RStudio Connect bind user (such as `t1-svc-cneranaibind`), ensure that you have updated the Bind Password in the RStudio Connect configuration to match the new password. You can do this by editing the `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg` file and updating the `BindPassword` field with the new password.\n\n     After making any necessary changes to your RStudio Connect configuration, restart the RStudio Connect service to apply the changes. You can do this by running the command `systemctl restart rstudio-connect`.\n\n     Finally, test the LDAP authentication settings by attempting to log in to RStudio Connect using a valid user account. If you encounter any issues or errors during the login process, review the RStudio Connect logs for more detailed information about the error.\n\n    By following these steps and verifying that your RStudio Connect configuration is correct, you should be able to resolve the user authentication issue and successfully log in to RStudio Connect using a valid user account.",

For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n7. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n8. Due to the fact that the server is not directly connected to the Internet, R-Studio Connect might display an error about expired license after the reboot. In this case follow the steps listed [below](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect).\n9. Inform users that the application is available.\n### Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect\n1.

        "question": "How do you change the domain in RStudio Connect?",
        "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
        "ground_truth": "Backup the current configuration, update `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg` with new LDAP settings, and restart the service with `systemctl restart rstudio-connect`.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To change the domain in RStudio Connect, you need to update the configuration file `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`. Specifically, you need to change the `ServerAddress` field to point to the new domain. Additionally, you may need to update other fields such as `UserSearchBaseDN`, `GroupSearchBaseDN`, and `PermittedLoginGroup` to match the new domain's configuration. After updating the configuration file, you need to restart RStudio Connect for the changes to take effect. \n\n    It is also important to note that changing the domain in RStudio Connect may require additional steps such as updating the SSL certificates, updating the firewall rules, and informing users of the change. \n\n    Therefore, it is recommended to carefully review the RStudio Connect documentation and consult with the RStudio support team if necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new domain. \n\n    In addition to the above steps, you may also need to update the `BindDN` and `BindPassword` fields in the configuration file to match the new domain's configuration. \n\n    Furthermore, you may need to update the `PublisherRoleMapping`, `ViewerRoleMapping`, and `AdministratorRoleMapping` fields in the configuration file to match the new domain's configuration. \n\n    It is also important to note that changing the domain in RStudio Connect may require additional steps such as updating the DNS records, updating the firewall rules, and informing users of the change. \n\n    Therefore, it is recommended to carefully review the RStudio Connect documentation and consult with the RStudio support team if necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new domain. \n\n    In summary, changing the domain in RStudio Connect requires careful planning and execution, including updating the configuration file, restarting RStudio Connect, and informing users of the change. It is recommended to carefully review the RStudio Connect documentation and consult with the RStudio support team if necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new domain. \n\n    I hope this helps!

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n```\n3.

Check that the specific pipeline has the status `RUNNING`. If it has any other status continue the investigation.   \n1. Open a pipeline. Check the generic summary (click anywhere in the board and select summary) to get an overview through dashboards on the data processed and errors. Also check if any job of the pipeline has errors (click on an action box and select tab Errors). Streamset will provide a specific ERROR message.\n**Step 2:** Look at the `logs`.\n**TO VIEW THE LOG FILE FOR A SPECIFIC PIPELINE:** `cat sdc.log | grep -i '<pipeline-grep-keyword>'`\n1. Through the `Stramsets UI`, `logs` can be viewed by pressing the paper icon (second) on the top right corner of the selected pipeline environment.\n### Component Metrics\n#### Creation of raw files\nThe source system in this case is NNM. For high availability there are two instances of NNM on two seperate servers and they operate in active-standby fashion. The whole infrastructure is entirely managed by abc.

        "ground_truth": "When multiple 'Impala Concurrent Client Connections' alarms appear, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the root cause by checking query logs in Cloudera.\n2. If queries are stalled, cancel them from `Cloudera > Impala > Queries`.\n3. Restart the Impala daemon on affected nodes.\n4. If the issue persists, analyze memory usage and consider redistributing workload across nodes.\nThese steps ensure that Impala recovers from heavy client loads and resumes processing efficiently.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To troubleshoot performance degradation in Impala caused by concurrent client connections, you can follow these steps:\n1. **Monitor Impala metrics**: Use tools like Cloudera Manager or Impala's built-in metrics to monitor the number of concurrent client connections, query execution times, and other relevant metrics.\n2. **Analyze Impala logs**: Check the Impala logs for any error messages or warnings related to concurrent client connections.\n3. **Adjust Impala configuration**: Based on your analysis, you may need to adjust Impala's configuration settings, such as the number of allowed concurrent client connections or the query execution timeout.\n4. **Implement connection pooling**: Consider implementing connection pooling mechanisms, such as Apache Hive's connection pooling feature, to reduce the overhead of establishing and closing client connections.\n5. **Monitor and optimize queries**: Regularly monitor and optimize your Impala queries to minimize their execution times and reduce the load on the Impala cluster.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and address performance degradation issues in Impala caused by concurrent client connections.",

The initial part of the response provides a command (`ipa-replica-manage list -v`) that seems related to managing replicas, which could be interpreted as somewhat relevant to checking replication status in HBase.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears there might be some confusion or mix-up with other technologies or commands (e.g., `ipa-replica-manage` seems more related to FreeIPA than HBase). The subsequent mention of using the `hbase shell` and the command `list_quotas` is relevant but does not directly answer how to check replication status.\n\nThe chatbot's response also includes a general statement about HBase replication being complex, which, while true, does not contribute directly to answering the query.\n\nGiven these observations, the response is somewhat relevant but lacks directness and clarity in addressing the specific question about checking HBase replication status.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 3**\n\nThis score reflects that the chatbot's response contains some relevant information but fails to directly answer the query or provide a clear, step-by-step solution for checking HBase replication status. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Feedback:** The provided command seems unrelated to HBase and more aligned with FreeIPA.

        "chatbot_answer": " You can manually update a failed job's status in Impala by using the following command:\n     ```\n     impala-shell -k --ssl -i ${HOSTNAME/01/} -q \"UPDATE jobstatus SET status='RUNNING' WHERE application='IPVPN-SM' AND component='MAIN_END' AND status='FAILED';\"\n     ```\n     This will update the status of the failed job to 'RUNNING', allowing the script to re-run.\n```\n## Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **Understanding the context**: The question is about manually updating a failed job's status in Impala to allow the script to re-run.\n\n2. **Identifying the issue**: The issue here is that a job has failed and its status needs to be updated manually in Impala for the script to proceed.\n\n3. **Determining the solution**: To solve this, one needs to update the status of the failed job from 'FAILED' to 'RUNNING' in the `jobstatus` table in Impala.\n\n## Fixed solution:\n```sql\nimpala-shell -k --ssl -i ${HOSTNAME/01/} -q \"UPDATE jobstatus SET status='RUNNING' WHERE application='IPVPN-SM' AND component='MAIN_END' AND status='FAILED';\"\n```\n\n## Explanation of changes:\n* **Identified the correct table and columns**: The `jobstatus` table in Impala contains the job statuses, and the `status` column needs to be updated.\n* **Specified the correct conditions for updating**: The update should only apply to rows where `application='IPVPN-SM'`, `component='MAIN_END'`, and `status='FAILED'`.\n* **Provided the correct SQL command for updating**: The `UPDATE` statement is used with the `SET` clause to specify the new value for the `status` column.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{impala-shell -k --ssl -i ${HOSTNAME/01/} -q \"UPDATE jobstatus SET status='RUNNING' WHERE application='IPVPN-SM' AND component='MAIN_END' AND status='FAILED';\"}$",

Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n# Support\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | FAILED  | com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.AppEmptyQueryException | 2023-05-10 07:05:02.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_START | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS | n_attempt=1                                                                | 2023-05-10 07:05:22.000 |\n| IPVPN-SM    | QOS | MAIN_END   | 20230510065500      | SUCCESS |                                                                            | 2023-05-10 07:05:35.000 |\n+-------------+-----+------------+---------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+\n4 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n```\nAccording to the above results, we conclude that the computation of the QOS metrics for the selected 5min interval failed on the first attempt with AppEmptyQueryException error.
