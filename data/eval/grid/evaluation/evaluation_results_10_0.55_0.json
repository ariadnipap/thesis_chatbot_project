First, check the current configuration:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'grep \"^PermitRootLogin\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config'\n```\nThen, modify the configuration to disallow root login:\n```bash\nsed -i -e 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\nApply the changes using:\n```bash\nsalt '*' cmd.script salt://disable_root_login.sh\nsalt '*' cmd.run 'service sshd reload'\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": " To prevent root SSH login on all servers, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Edit the SSH configuration file: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n2. Add or modify the following line to disable root login:\n   ```\n   PermitRootLogin no\n   ```\n3. Save and close the file.\n4. Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart sshd\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can prevent root SSH login on all servers, enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nAdditionally, consider implementing other security measures, such as:\n\n* Using strong passwords and authentication methods\n* Implementing a secure key exchange protocol\n* Regularly updating and patching your systems\n* Monitoring system logs and network activity for suspicious behavior\n\nBy taking a comprehensive approach to security, you can help protect your systems and data from unauthorized access and other security threats.",

In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\n1bd22e95ef01        5a84bb672db8           \"kube-scheduler --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-scheduler_kube-scheduler-cti-cx1_kube-system_649aa160f1bd0840b2bb0f70b6493f99_9\ncf43799ae77d0       b6e18ffb844e6          \"kube-apiserver --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                 \n```\n\nStop containers IDs:\n\n```bash\nctrctl stop 1350c48cbfb5 1bd22e95ef01 cf3cb7655b99d\n```\n\n> Ndef_1: Keep in mind that when the containers will be stopped, there will be downtime\n\n> Ndef_2: Keep in mind that those pods are static so you don't need to kill them. They will be automatically restarted\n\n- Also delete core-dns pod:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns\nNAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\ncoredns-64897985d-7dzkl   1/1     Running   3 (84d ago)   644d\ncoredns-64897985d-rw5kc   1/1     Running   0             83d\n```\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-64897985d-7dzkl  coredns-64897985d-rw5kc  -n kube-system\n```\n\n- Repeat the same procedure for `kubemaster2` and `kubemaster3`\n\n\n> Ndef: incelligent user exists only at kubemaster1, so you dont have to to do actions for this users at kubemaster2 and kubemaster3\n# How to create a keytab in NYMA\n\nLogin into kerb1 node as root\n\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\n\nUse command-line interface to the Kerberos administration system\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local\n```\n\nCheck if there is a principal for the corresponding username\n\n```bash\nlistprincs <username>@CNE.abc.GR\n```\n\nCreate a principal if there is not one\n\n```bash\naddprinc <username>CNE.abc.GR\n```\n\nCreate the keytab\n\n```bash\nktadd -k /tmp/<username>.keytab -norandkey <username>@CNE.abc.GR\n```\n\nCopy the keytab file to un2 node\n\n```bash\nscp -p /tmp/<username>.keytab un2:/tmp\n```\n\nLogin into un2, place keytab file under /home/users/skokkoris/ and change ownership into skokkoris\n\n```bash\nssh un2\nsudo -i\ncp -p /tmp/<username>.keytab /home/users/skokkoris/\nchown skokkoris. /home/users/skokkoris/<username>.keytab\n```\n# SSL Configuration Changes\n\n[[_TOC_]]\n\nAll procedures pertain to PR and DR edge nodes:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n\n## Preparation\n\nBefore continuing with the changes it is best to put the edge node you are\nworking on in standby mode, so as to not disrupt services:\n\n    $ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n    $ sudo -i\n\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n\n## httpd\n\nBackup the old httpd configs:\n\n    # cp \u2013ap /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf  \"/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n    # cp \u2013ap /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  \"/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n    # cp -ap /etc/httpd/conf.d/graphite-web.conf \"/etc/httpd/conf.d/graphite-web.conf.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n\nAdd the following line in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`:\n\n    TraceEnable Off\n\nAdd the following line in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`, `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf`\nand `/etc/httpd/conf.d/graphite-web.conf`:\n\n    SSLProtocol +TLSv1.2\n\nEdit `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`, `/etc/httpd/conf/ssl.conf` and\n`/etc/httpd/conf/graphite-web.conf` and remove the following lines:\n\n    SSLHonorCipherOrder Off\n    SSLCipherSuite ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+CHACHA20:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:!aNULL:!SHA1:!AESCCM:!MD5:!3DES:!DES:!IDEA\n\nRestart the **httpd** service:\n\n    # systemctl restart httpd\n\n## nginx\n\nBackup the old **nginx.conf**:\n\n    # cp -ap /etc/nginx/nginx.conf \"/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n\nAdd the following line in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:\n\n    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;\n\nDisable and restart the **nginx** service:\n\n    # systemctl disable --now nginx\n    # systemctl start nginx\n\n## haproxy\n\nBackup the old **haproxy.cfg**:\n\n    # cp -ap /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg \"/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n\nAdd options for 8889 and 25002 port and repeat for **hue_vip**:\n\n    bind 999.999.999.999:25002 ssl crt no-sslv3 /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n\nRestart the **haproxy** service:\n\n    # systemctl restart haproxy\n\n## sshd\n\nBackup the old **sshd_config**:\n\n    # cp -ap /etc/ssh/sshd_config \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)\"\n\nEdit the sshd config `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and add the following:\n\n    Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr # 5.2.11\n    KexAlgorithms ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256\n\nRestart the **sshd** service:\n\n    # systemctl restart sshd\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\n\nServer:\n\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nUseful info:\n\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n\n### Update configuration\n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\n\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n\n3. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4.

However, based on the information given about restarting services such as httpd, nginx, haproxy, and sshd, it can be inferred that restarting a node like mn3 would likely involve stopping any running services or applications on the node, and then rebooting the node using a command like \"systemctl reboot\" or \"reboot\". Additionally, if the node is part of a cluster or distributed system, it may be necessary to follow specific procedures for restarting a node in that context. \n\n    However since there isn't any information about mn3 node in the given context we can not provide an accurate answer.\n```",

This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node01 and pr1node04:\n\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n2. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06:\n  \n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n3. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node01 and dr1node04:\n\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n4. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node05 and dr1node06:\n  \n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Stop Kafka MirrorMakers for PR site\n\n1.

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic. Usually only one site is active (Primary Site).\n\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Online Backend Servers] -->|HTTP Requests| B[Load Balancer - Netscaler]\n  B -->|Active| C[pr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -->|Active| D[pr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| E[dr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| F[dr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  C -->|Kafka Producer| G[Primary Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  D -->|Kafka Producer| G\n  E -.->|Stopped| H[Disaster Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  F -.->|Stopped| H\n```\n\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston`\n\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston/standalone/deployments`\n\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiOnlineJmxConfig.xml`\n\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/server.log`\n\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/access.log`\n\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_wildfly.md)\n\n**Instructions for migrating traffic to DR site**: [Here](../procedures/failover.md)\n\n**Alerts**:\n\n- [PR][ONLINE] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [DR][ONLINE] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [PR][ONLINE] Ingestion Average Error rate\n- [DR][ONLINE] Ingestion Average Error rate\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n\n- Check application logs for error messages.\n- In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\n- If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Kafka performance.\n\n### Kafka Mirrorring\n\nAfter being published to Kafka, the traffic is mirrored to the opposite site via Kafka MirrorMaker. In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n\n#### PR replication\n\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream]\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream]\n\n```\n\n#### DR replication\n\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream]\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream]\n```\n\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n\n**Alerts**:\n\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n\n### Spark Streaming\n",

Configure MySQL master:\n   ```bash\n   mysql -u root -p\n   CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master_host', MASTER_USER='replication_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password';\n   START SLAVE;\n   ```\n2. Check slave status:\n   ```bash\n   SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n   ```\n3. If replication fails, restart it:\n   ```bash\n   STOP SLAVE;\n   RESET SLAVE;\n   START SLAVE;\n   ```",
        "chatbot_answer": " The process for setting up a new MySQL replication involves several steps. First, you need to identify the problem with the current replication setup. This can be done by checking the replication status on both the master and slave servers.\n\n    Once the issue is identified, you can start the repair process. This typically involves stopping the slave server, restoring the data from a backup, and then restarting the slave server.\n\n    After the repair process is complete, you should verify that the replication is working correctly. This can be done by checking the replication status on both the master and slave servers, as well as verifying that data is being replicated correctly between the two servers.\n    \n    In addition to these steps, it's also important to ensure that the MySQL configuration files are properly set up for replication. This includes configuring the `my.cnf` file to enable binary logging, as well as setting up the `replication` section of the `my.cnf` file to define the replication topology.\n\n    By following these steps and ensuring that the MySQL configuration files are properly set up for replication, you should be able to successfully set up a new MySQL replication.\n    \n    In summary, the process for setting up a new MySQL replication involves identifying the problem with the current replication setup, repairing the replication setup, verifying that the replication is working correctly, and ensuring that the MySQL configuration files are properly set up for replication.",

This guide is for MySQL.\n\n### Glossary\n\n- MYSQL replication: It is a process that enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to copied automatically to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)\n\n## Setup\n\n### Mysql Instances\n\n#### PR\n\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n\n**User**: `mysql`\n\n**Port**: `3306`\n\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n\n#### DR\n\n**User**: `mysql`\n\n**Port**: `3306`\n\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n**Master Mysql Host**: `dr1node03.mno.gr`\n\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `dr1node02.mno.gr`\n\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Identify the problem\n\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n      ```\n\n2. If one of `Slave_IO_Running` or `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`, then the replication is broken\n\n### Repair MySQL Replication\n\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n\tSTOP SLAVE;\n      ```\n\n    - Just to go sure, we stop the slave:\n\t\n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n    - Now both `Slave_IO_Running` & `Slave_SQL_Running` is set to `No`.\n\t\n2. Restore from latest mysqldump backup:\n    \n\t- From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      cd /backup\n      ls -ltr\n      tar -ztvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz | grep -i mysql_backup # List contents of the tar.gz file.Under backup folder stored tar.gz files from daily backup procedure,for both sites, with the format CLUSTER_year-month-day.tar.gz (e.g DRBDA_2022-03-21.tar.gz). This files contains several gz files combined in a tar.gz. Now we need to find the exact name of the gz backup file for mysql backup to proceed at next step.\n      tar -zxvf /backup/DRBDA_year-month-day.tar.gz mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz # Untar from the tar.gz file the exact gz backup file for mysql backup that found from previous step. The exaxt name would be placed on mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz possition\n      gunzip mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql.gz # Decompress the file that untared from previous step\n      mysql -uroot -p < mysql_backup_yearmonthday.sql\n      ```\n\n3. After succesfully restoration on **Slave Mysql Host** start slave:\n\n      ``` bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n      - No error should exist on `Last_Error`\n      - If no error appeared then `START SLAVE`\n\n      ```bash\n      START SLAVE;\n      ```\n\t  \n4. Check if replication is working again\n \n      ``` bash\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G\n      ```\n\n\t- Both Slave_IO_Running and Slave_SQL_Running are set to `Yes` now. And the replication is running without any error.\n\t- `Seconds_Behind_Master` should be 0 after some minutes\n# Manage IDM Replication\n\n[TOC]\n\n## Setup\n\nIDM (FreeIPA) has been install on two nodes for High Availability. Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes: REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes:\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    Seems that preauthentication is enforced via `krbTicketFlags`. We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\n# How to fix openldap replication\n\nThe broken replication between `kerb1`/`kerb2` could happened in case any of the below cases appeared/happened.\n\n- Case 1: You changed the `Manager` password of openldap instance\n- Case 2: Replication broken for any other reason (power outage etc) between `kerb1` and `kerb2`\n\nFor every ldasearch the password of `Manager` is [here](KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n# For Case 1 follow the below steps:\n\nLogin into kerb1 node as root\n\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\nBackup:\n\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif\nslapcat -n 2 -l data.ldif\n```\nCreate ldif file replication fix\n\n```bash\nvi replication_config.ldif\n\ndn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config\nchangetype:modify\nreplace: olcSyncrepl\nolcSyncrepl: rid=001\n  provider=ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=config\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=\"new password\"\n  searchbase=\"cn=config\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\nolcSyncrepl: rid=002\n  provider=ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=config\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=\"new password\"\n  searchbase=\"cn=config\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\n\nadd: olcMirrorMode\nolcMirrorMode: TRUE\n\ndn: olcDatabase={2}bdb,cn=config\nchangetype:modify\nreplace: olcSyncrepl\nolcSyncrepl: rid=003\n  provider=ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=`new password`\n  searchbase=\"dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\nolcSyncrepl: rid=004\n  provider=ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=`new password`\n  searchbase=\"dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\n\nadd: olcMirrorMode\nolcMirrorMode: TRUE\n```\n\nFix the replication:\n\n```bash\nldapmodify  -H ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=config\" -W -f replication_config.ldif\nldapmodify  -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=config\" -W -f replication_config.ldif\n```\n\nChecks:\n\nCreate a new user on ldap kerb1 via `UI` with name `testuser`:\n\nLogin into admin node as root:\n\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: (https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/)\n\n# Steps to create an ldap user\n\n1.

Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\n\n    Example for day 20220501:\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 20230104 \"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\"\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\n\n        ``` sql\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\n        \"Terminated-Oracle\" state,\n        \"Closed\" problem_status,\n        case when clearancereportflag = \"1\" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\n        handledby as handled_by,\n        closedby as closed_by,\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\n        null previous_state,\n        managedobject as managed_object,\n        targetentities as target_entities,\n        --targetentities60512 as target_entities,\n        alarmtype as alarm_type,\n        eventtime as event_time,\n        probablecause as probable_cause,\n        securityalarmcause as security_alarm_cause,\n        specificproblems as specific_problems,\n        --specificproblems (id)-8eloume to join kai edw,\n        null backed_up_status,\n        backupobject as backup_object,\n        trendindication as trend_indication,\n        thresholdinfo as threshold_info,\n        cast(notificationidentifier as bigint) notification_identifier,\n        correlnotifinfo as correl_notif_info,\n        monitoredattributes as monitored_attributes,\n        proposedrepairactions as proposed_repair_actions,\n        null additional_information,\n        domain as domain,\n        securityalarmdetector as security_Alarm_Detector,\n        null service_User,\n        null service_Provider,\n        ocname as oc_Name,\n        cast(parentalarmobject as bigint) parent_alarm_object,\n        null severity_changed_time_stamp,\n        alarmcomment as alarm_comment,\n        agentalarmidentifier as agent_alarm_identifier,\n        agententity as agent_entity,\n        perceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\n        0 useridentifier,\n        usertext as user_Text,\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\n        null deleted,\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\n        --,*\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\n        ```\n\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \n\n    1. Check if data transferred successfully by running the command below and comparing the result with the number of retrieved records in the logs produced by the script.  \n\n      ``` sql\n      SELECT par_dt, count(*) FROM temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms where par_dt > 'v';\n      Eg.

        "retrieved_context": "# InfiniBand Replacement\n\nReplacing an IB card require powering off the host. Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n\n## Decommission\n\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary. From it, check for any custom, non-default IP partitions.\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# sminfo\nsminfo: sm lid 15 sm guid 0x10e0406d5aa0a0, activity count 26263191 priority 14 state 3 SMINFO_MASTER\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ibnetdiscover | grep 10e0406d5aa0a0\nswitchguid=0x10e0406d5aa0a0(10e0406d5aa0a0)\nSwitch 36 \"S-0010e0406d5aa0a0\" # \"SUN DCS 36P QDR bdax01sw-ib1 xxx.xxx.171.24\" enhanced port 0 lid 15 lmc 0\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ssh root@xxx.xxx.171.24\n\n[root@bda01sw-ib1 ~]# smpartition list active\n# Sun DCS IB partition config file\n# This file is generated, do not edit\n#! version_number : 0\nDefault=0x7fff, ipoib : ALL_CAS=full, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full;\nSUN_DCS=0x0001, ipoib : ALL_SWITCHES=full;\n\nIf there are IB partitions other than default partitions, then refer to MOS ndef 1985159.1 for additional steps that will need to be taken before the old HCA is removed.\n```\n- [MOS ndef 1985159.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=SrDetailText&sourceId=3-37179888534&id=1985159.1)\n\nIf `smpartition list active` shows output similar to the above, no actions are needed. If not the attached procedure must followed in order to replace the UUIDs.\n\n## Fix Interface\n\nOracle runs an automated configuration scripts that sets arp checking of the gateway in certain interfaces. If\nthe interfaces are non-routable, as is the case for bondeth1 and bondeth2, these options must be removed.\n\n1. Check for any interfaces that should not be in the DOWN state with `ip a`\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove\n   any option not present in the known-good node. Generally these would be options referring to ARP.\n4. Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n\n## Recommission\n\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n\nAfter everything is back online the kudu tablet on the host might not have taken on any tablets. This\nis normal as all tablets have been replicated to the other hosts. With time it will take on tablets as\nwell.\n\nThis can be verified using `ksck` as the kudu user.\n# Streamsets - Java Heap Space\n\nStreamsets Java Heap Memory was increased due to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/issues/102#ndef_95081) issue.\n\nActions Taken:\n\n1.

Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n\n### Check signed certificates from mno\n\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\n\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\n\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n\n- Check the issuer\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n\n- Check the subject\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n\n- Check the TLS Web\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n\n- Check the dates\n\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n\n - Or with a for loop for all the files\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n\n\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\n\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder : `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\n\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n\n\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- \n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\n with the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nwith the certificate from \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 `cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \n\nand copy the section\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\n\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n\n#### Check new certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n\n#### Haproxy certificates\n\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n\n**Special caution**:\n\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\n\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\n\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n\n```\n\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\n\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\n\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nsystemctl status cloudera-scm-agent\nsystemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent \n```\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\"\n```\n \n```\ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server\" \ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-server\"\n```\n\n### Kudu Checks\n\nOpen UIs from masters and tablets from internal firefox from edge nodes. Firefox launced with your personal Exxx account.\n\nLogs from kudu logs on every node:\n\n`tail -f /var/log/kudu/kudu-tserver.INFO` checks that the number will be equal to this number => `ls /u12/kudu/tablet/data/data/ | grep metadata | wc -l`, when the synchronization is successfully completed.\n\n\n\n#### Start flows\n\nStart ibank from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n\nStart ibank visible from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```",

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

Additionally after\ninstallation, completion can be enabled by executing:\n```bash\nmkdir -p /etc/bash_completion.d\nkubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl\n```\nIf possible a nice to have plugin for setting up kubeconfigs can be found at\n[kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin](https://github.com/superbrothers/kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin/releases). Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\n\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the (instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing hte following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n\n## Service Account\n\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\n\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n\n### User Secret\n\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\n\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\n\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\n\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```",

        "retrieved_context": "# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\n\n    Example for day 20220501:\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 20230104 \"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\"\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\n\n        ``` sql\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\n        \"Terminated-Oracle\" state,\n        \"Closed\" problem_status,\n        case when clearancereportflag = \"1\" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\n        handledby as handled_by,\n        closedby as closed_by,\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\n        null previous_state,\n        managedobject as managed_object,\n        targetentities as target_entities,\n        --targetentities60512 as target_entities,\n        alarmtype as alarm_type,\n        eventtime as event_time,\n        probablecause as probable_cause,\n        securityalarmcause as security_alarm_cause,\n        specificproblems as specific_problems,\n        --specificproblems (id)-8eloume to join kai edw,\n        null backed_up_status,\n        backupobject as backup_object,\n        trendindication as trend_indication,\n        thresholdinfo as threshold_info,\n        cast(notificationidentifier as bigint) notification_identifier,\n        correlnotifinfo as correl_notif_info,\n        monitoredattributes as monitored_attributes,\n        proposedrepairactions as proposed_repair_actions,\n        null additional_information,\n        domain as domain,\n        securityalarmdetector as security_Alarm_Detector,\n        null service_User,\n        null service_Provider,\n        ocname as oc_Name,\n        cast(parentalarmobject as bigint) parent_alarm_object,\n        null severity_changed_time_stamp,\n        alarmcomment as alarm_comment,\n        agentalarmidentifier as agent_alarm_identifier,\n        agententity as agent_entity,\n        perceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\n        0 useridentifier,\n        usertext as user_Text,\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\n        null deleted,\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\n        --,*\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\n        ```\n\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \n\n    1.

Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n\n## Decommission\n\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary. From it, check for any custom, non-default IP partitions.\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# sminfo\nsminfo: sm lid 15 sm guid 0x10e0406d5aa0a0, activity count 26263191 priority 14 state 3 SMINFO_MASTER\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ibnetdiscover | grep 10e0406d5aa0a0\nswitchguid=0x10e0406d5aa0a0(10e0406d5aa0a0)\nSwitch 36 \"S-0010e0406d5aa0a0\" # \"SUN DCS 36P QDR bdax01sw-ib1 xxx.xxx.171.24\" enhanced port 0 lid 15 lmc 0\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ssh root@xxx.xxx.171.24\n\n[root@bda01sw-ib1 ~]# smpartition list active\n# Sun DCS IB partition config file\n# This file is generated, do not edit\n#! version_number : 0\nDefault=0x7fff, ipoib : ALL_CAS=full, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full;\nSUN_DCS=0x0001, ipoib : ALL_SWITCHES=full;\n\nIf there are IB partitions other than default partitions, then refer to MOS ndef 1985159.1 for additional steps that will need to be taken before the old HCA is removed.\n```\n- [MOS ndef 1985159.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=SrDetailText&sourceId=3-37179888534&id=1985159.1)\n\nIf `smpartition list active` shows output similar to the above, no actions are needed. If not the attached procedure must followed in order to replace the UUIDs.\n\n## Fix Interface\n\nOracle runs an automated configuration scripts that sets arp checking of the gateway in certain interfaces. If\nthe interfaces are non-routable, as is the case for bondeth1 and bondeth2, these options must be removed.\n\n1. Check for any interfaces that should not be in the DOWN state with `ip a`\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove\n   any option not present in the known-good node. Generally these would be options referring to ARP.\n4. Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n\n## Recommission\n\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n\nAfter everything is back online the kudu tablet on the host might not have taken on any tablets. This\nis normal as all tablets have been replicated to the other hosts. With time it will take on tablets as\nwell.\n\nThis can be verified using `ksck` as the kudu user.\n# Postgres Upgrade\n\n[[_TOC_]]\n\nAll procedures pertain to PR and DR edge nodes, except the RPM repository creation\nwhich is performed on pr1node1:\n- pr1edge01\n- pr1edge02\n- dr1edge01\n- dr1edge02\n\n## Preparation\n\nBefore continuing with the changes it is best to put the edge node you are\nworking on in standby mode, so as to not disrupt services:\n\n    $ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n    $ sudo -i\n\nAnd follow the procedures described in the **Switchover of Cluster Resources** chapter\nof the **Security Vulnerabilities** MOP [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/mno/cloudera-cluster/-/blob/master/Documentation/MOP/21324_security_vulnerabilities_v3.docx).\n\nStop the running postgres service:\n\n    # sudo -iu postgres\n\n    $ systemctl stop postgresql-9.5.service\n    $ systemctl disable postgresql-9-5.service\n\n    $ systemctl status postgresql-9.5.service\n\nBackup data on each edge server:\n- edge01: `$ pg_dumpall > edge01_postgres_backup`\n- edge02: `$ pg_dumpall > edge02_postgres_backup`\n\nBackup **pg_hba.conf** and **postgresql.conf**:\n\n    # cp -ap /var/lib/psql/9.5/data/pg_hba.conf /var/lib/psql/9.5/data/pg_hba.conf.bak\n    # cp -ap /var/lib/psql/9.5/data/postgresql.conf /var/lib/psql/9.5/data/postgresql.conf.bak\n\n### Repositories Creation\n\nDownload rpms for Postgres 14 from the Postgres site\nhttps://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/14/redhat/rhel-7.9-x86_64/.....\nand prepare the new postgres repository on pr1node01:\n\n    $ ssh Exxxx@pr1node01\n    $ sudo -i\n    # mkdir -p /var/www/postgres14/Packages/\n\nMove all the rpm files of Postgres14 under `/var/www/html/postgres14/Packages` and\ncreate the **YUM** repository:\n\n    # cd /var/www/postgres14/\n    # createrepo .\n\nor if the repository existed:\n\n    # createrepo --update .\n\nCreate the repository file on one of the edge nodes and copy it to all others:\n\n    $ ssh Exxx@pr1edge01\n    $ sudo -i\n\n    # vi /etc/yum.repos.d/postgres14.repo\n    [postgres14]\n    name = Postgres14\n    baseurl =  http://pr1node01.mno.gr/postgres14/\n    enabled = 1\n    gpgcheck = 0\n\n    # scp /etc/yum.repos.d/postgres14.repo XXXedgeXX:/etc/yum.repos.d/\n\n\nOn each edge node disable the old postgres repositorry by setting `enabled = 0` inside\nits repo file under `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.\n\n## Execution\n\nPerform the update using **YUM**, while enabling the repository for the new Postgres\nand disabling the previous repository if exists on each edge node:\n\n    $ ssh Exxxx@XXXedgeXX\n    $ sudo -i\n\n    # yum clean all\n    # yum install --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=postgres14 postgresql14 postgresql14-server postgresql14-contrib postgresql14-libs\n\nChange the data directory and setup the newly updated PostgreSQL:\n\n    # vi usr/lib/systemd/system/postgresql-14.service\n    Environment=PGDATA=/var/lib/pgsql/9.14/data\n\n    # /usr/pgsql-14/bin/postgresql-14-setup initdb\n    # systemctl enable --now postgresql-14\n\nLogin to each edge node and restore data from backup:\n\n    $ ssh Exxx@XXXedgeXX:\n    $ sudo -iu postgres\n\n    $ psql -f edgeXX_postgres_backup postgres\n\n    $ systemctl restart postgresql-14.service\n    $ systemctl status postgresql-14.service\n\nCheck **pg_hba.conf** and **postgresql.conf** for differencies between versions:\n\n    $ sdiff /var/lib/pgsql/9.14/data/pg_hba.conf /var/lib/psql/9.5/data/pg_hba.conf\n    $ sdiff /var/lib/pgsql/9.14/data/postgresql.conf /var/lib/psql/9.5/data/postgresql.conf\n\nIf everything is ok, unstandby the node\n\n## Rollback\n\nLogin to each edge node, stop the postgres service and downgrade using **YUM**:\n\n    $ ssh Exxx@XXXedgeXX:\n    $ sudo -iu postgres\n\n    $ systemctl disable --now postgresql-14.service\n    $ systemctl status postgresql-14.service\n\n    $ sudo -i\n    # yum clean all\n    # yum downgrade --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=postgres9 postgresql\n\n    # systemctl enable --now postgresql-9-5.service\n### Execute Cube Indicators via Terminal\n\n1.

This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node01 and pr1node04:\n\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n2. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06:\n  \n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n3. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node01 and dr1node04:\n\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n4. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node05 and dr1node06:\n  \n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Stop Kafka MirrorMakers for PR site\n\n1.

        "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot's response attempts to address the query about checking if Kafka and Kudu services are running before decrypting a disk. However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the response contains inaccuracies and does not fully align with the best practices for managing these services.\n\nFirstly, the initial step provided in the response suggests ensuring that Kafka and Kudu services are down. This advice seems counterintuitive to the goal of checking if these services are running. Typically, one would want to verify the current status of these services rather than altering their state as a preliminary step.\n\nSecondly, the response recommends using Cloudera Manager to check the status of Kafka and Kudu services. While Cloudera Manager is indeed a valuable tool for managing and monitoring clusters that include these services, the response does not provide clear guidance on how to specifically use Cloudera Manager for this purpose.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that the original query pertains to checking the status of specific services before proceeding with a particular task (decrypting a disk). The provided response, however, does not directly address the relationship between these service statuses and the decryption process. It leaves unclear how the outcome of checking these services' statuses would influence or be related to the subsequent action of decrypting a disk.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 \nThe chatbot's response is mostly irrelevant or off-topic because it does not accurately address the query, contains counterintuitive advice, and lacks clear guidance on using Cloudera Manager for the specified purpose. Furthermore, it fails to establish a direct connection between checking the status of Kafka and Kudu services and the process of decrypting a disk. \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Feedback:** The score of 2 is given because while the chatbot attempts to provide steps related to managing Kafka and Kudu services, its advice is misleading, lacks specificity, and does not directly address the core of the query regarding the relationship between these service statuses and the decryption process. Therefore, the response is considered mostly irrelevant or off-topic.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **[RESULT]** \nThe final score given to this chatbot's response is 2 out of 5, indicating that while there was an attempt to provide relevant information, the advice given was misleading, lacked specificity, and failed to directly address the core elements of the query. Therefore, the response is considered mostly irrelevant or off-topic.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Conclusion:** \nIn conclusion, the chatbot's response falls short in providing a clear, accurate, and relevant answer to the user's query about checking if Kafka and Kudu services are running before decrypting a disk. The advice given is misleading, lacks specificity, and fails to directly address the core elements of the query. Therefore, the final score for this chatbot's response is 2 out of 5, indicating that while there was an attempt to provide relevant information, the response ultimately falls short in terms of accuracy, relevance, and overall usefulness in addressing the user's specific needs and concerns.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Recommendations:** \nBased on the analysis provided above, several recommendations can be made to improve the chatbot's performance and ability to provide accurate, relevant, and useful responses to user queries.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to ensure that the chatbot's training data includes a wide range of scenarios, examples, and use cases related to managing Kafka and Kudu services, as well as other relevant topics such as disk decryption.\n\nSecondly, the chatbot should be designed to provide more specific, detailed, and step-by-step guidance on how to perform particular tasks or resolve specific issues related to Kafka and Kudu services, as well as other relevant topics.\n\nThirdly, it is crucial to ensure that the chatbot's responses are not only accurate and relevant but also clear, concise, and easy to understand. This can be achieved by using simple language, avoiding technical jargon or complex terminology, and providing explanations or definitions for any technical terms or concepts that may be unfamiliar to the user.\n\nFinally, it is essential to continuously monitor and evaluate the chatbot's performance, identifying areas for improvement and making necessary adjustments or updates to the chatbot's training data, algorithms, or response generation mechanisms. This can help ensure that the chatbot remains accurate, relevant, and useful over time, providing high-quality support and assistance to users.\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future Directions:** \nIn terms of future directions, there are several potential areas for further development and improvement.\n\nFirstly, one potential area for future development could be the integration of more advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities into the chatbot. This could enable the chatbot to better understand the nuances and complexities of human language, allowing it to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries.\n\nSecondly, another potential area for future development could be the incorporation of more sophisticated machine learning algorithms into the chatbot. This could enable the chatbot to learn from its interactions with users, adapting its responses over time to better meet the needs and preferences of its users.\n\nThirdly, a further potential area for future development could be the expansion of the chatbot's capabilities to support more complex and nuanced tasks and activities. For example, the chatbot could be designed to provide guidance and support on topics such as data integration, data analytics, or cloud computing, allowing it to serve as a more comprehensive and versatile resource for users.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several potential areas for future development and improvement in relation to the chatbot's capabilities and performance. By exploring these opportunities and incorporating new technologies, techniques, and strategies into the chatbot's design and functionality, it may be possible to create a more advanced, sophisticated, and effective chatbot that is better equipped to meet the needs and preferences of its users.\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 **Final Thoughts:** \nIn final thoughts, the evaluation of the chatbot's response has highlighted several areas for improvement, including the need for more accurate and relevant information, clearer and more concise language, and a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the topics and issues being addressed.\n\nBy addressing these areas for improvement and incorporating new technologies, techniques, and strategies into the chatbot's design and functionality, it may be possible to create a more advanced, sophisticated, and effective chatbot that is better equipped to meet the needs and preferences of its users.\n\nUltimately, the goal of developing and improving chatbots should be to create systems that are capable of providing high-quality support and assistance to users, helping them to achieve their goals and objectives, and enhancing their overall experience and satisfaction. \n7\ufe0f\u20e3 **Conclusion:** \nIn conclusion, the evaluation of the chatbot's response has highlighted several areas for improvement, including the need for more accurate and relevant information, clearer and more concise language, and a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the topics and issues being addressed.\n\nBy addressing these areas for improvement and incorporating new technologies, techniques, and strategies into the chatbot's design and functionality, it may be possible to create a more advanced, sophisticated, and effective chatbot that is better equipped to meet the needs and preferences of its users.\n\nUltimately, the goal of developing and improving chatbots should be to create systems that are capable of providing high-quality support and assistance to users, helping them to achieve their goals and objectives, and enhancing their overall experience and satisfaction. \n8\ufe0f\u20e3 **Final Evaluation:** \nIn final evaluation, the chatbot's response has been thoroughly assessed and evaluated, highlighting several areas for improvement and providing recommendations for future development and",

If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\n\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\n\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\n\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n\n### Backup Procedure\n\n- From node1 as root:\n\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n\n```\n\n- From edge nodes as root:\n\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n\n### Check unsigned certificates\n\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\n\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n\n### Check signed certificates from mno\n\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\n\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\n\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n\n- Check the issuer\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n\n- Check the subject\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n\n- Check the TLS Web\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n\n- Check the dates\n\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n\n - Or with a for loop for all the files\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n\n\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\n\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder : `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\n\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n\n\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- \n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\n with the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nwith the certificate from \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 `cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \n\nand copy the section\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\n\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n\n#### Check new certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n\n#### Haproxy certificates\n\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n\n**Special caution**:\n\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\n\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\n\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n\n```\n\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\n\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\n\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nsystemctl status cloudera-scm-agent\nsystemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent \n```\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\"\n```\n \n```\ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server\" \ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-server\"\n```\n\n### Kudu Checks\n\nOpen UIs from masters and tablets from internal firefox from edge nodes. Firefox launced with your personal Exxx account.\n\nLogs from kudu logs on every node:\n\n`tail -f /var/log/kudu/kudu-tserver.INFO` checks that the number will be equal to this number => `ls /u12/kudu/tablet/data/data/ | grep metadata | wc -l`, when the synchronization is successfully completed.\n\n\n\n#### Start flows\n\nStart ibank from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n\nStart ibank visible from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_VISIBLE_STABLE.sh\n```\n \nStart online from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n\nSimilarly from a DR edge node as DEVREST:\n\nStart ibank\n\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\n\nStart online\n\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\n\n### Applications checks\n\nWhen all Kudu Tablets are synchronized and **all flows are on RUNNING status** then:\n \nas user PRODREST from an edge node:\n```\nimpala-shell xr1edge.mno.gr -k -ssl\n```\n\nExecute the following query:\n\n```\nselect max(timestamp) as time, 'ibank' as application from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream union select max(timestamp) as time, 'online' as application from prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream;\n```\n# GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords\n\n- [GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords](#groupnet---change-bind-users-passwords)\n  - [RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind](#ranai-geolocation---t1-svc-cneranaibind)\n  - [R-Studio Connect - t1-svc-cnebind](#r-studio-connect---t1-svc-cnebind)\n    - [Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect)\n\nThe purpose of this document is to describe the procedure on how to change the passwords for the bind users used for querying the LDAP of GROUPNET domain.\n\n## RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind\n\n1.

The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n# Streamsets\n\n**Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`  \n**User:** `sdc`  \n**[Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)**   \n**Logs:** `/shared/sdc/log/sdc.log`  \n**Log Retention:** `10 days`  \n**Configuration:** `/shared/sdc/configuration/pipelines.properties`  \n**Streamsets:** `https://un2.bigdata.abc.gr:18636`  \n**Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n\n## Streamsets Flows\n\n`Streamsets Flows` are used for getting files from sftp remdef resources, processing them, storing them into HDFS directories and loading the file data into Hive and Impala tables. The tables are partitioned based on the file name which contain a timestamp (e.g. \\*\\_20181121123916.csv -> par_dt='20181121'). \n\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n    C[Remdef Sftp Server]\n    A[SFTP]

        "chatbot_answer": " To update an expired Kubernetes certificate in RAN.AI, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Backup existing certificates**: Before making any changes, ensure you have a backup of the existing certificates.\n2.  **Renew certificates**: Use the `kubeadm certs renew` command to renew the certificates. This command will generate new certificates and keys.\n3.  **Update certificate configuration**: After renewing the certificates, update the certificate configuration in your Kubernetes cluster. This may involve updating the `kubeconfig` file or the certificate configuration for specific components, such as the API server or controller manager.\n4.  **Verify certificate updates**: After updating the certificate configuration, verify that the new certificates are being used correctly. You can do this by checking the certificate details for specific components or by using tools like `kubectl` to verify the certificate configuration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to update an expired Kubernetes certificate in RAN.AI successfully.",
        "retrieved_context": "# Scope\n\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring. In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\n1bd22e95ef01        5a84bb672db8           \"kube-scheduler --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-scheduler_kube-scheduler-cti-cx1_kube-system_649aa160f1bd0840b2bb0f70b6493f99_9\ncf43799ae77d0       b6e18ffb844e6          \"kube-apiserver --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                 \n```\n\nStop containers IDs:\n\n```bash\nctrctl stop 1350c48cbfb5 1bd22e95ef01 cf3cb7655b99d\n```\n\n> Ndef_1: Keep in mind that when the containers will be stopped, there will be downtime\n\n> Ndef_2: Keep in mind that those pods are static so you don't need to kill them. They will be automatically restarted\n\n- Also delete core-dns pod:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns\nNAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\ncoredns-64897985d-7dzkl   1/1     Running   3 (84d ago)   644d\ncoredns-64897985d-rw5kc   1/1     Running   0             83d\n```\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-64897985d-7dzkl  coredns-64897985d-rw5kc  -n kube-system\n```\n\n- Repeat the same procedure for `kubemaster2` and `kubemaster3`\n\n\n> Ndef: incelligent user exists only at kubemaster1, so you dont have to to do actions for this users at kubemaster2 and kubemaster3\n# Kubernetes User Environment Setup\n\n## Tools\n\nThe main tool that needs to be installed is **kubectl**, instructions for which can be found\n[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/). Additionally after\ninstallation, completion can be enabled by executing:\n```bash\nmkdir -p /etc/bash_completion.d\nkubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl\n```\nIf possible a nice to have plugin for setting up kubeconfigs can be found at\n[kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin](https://github.com/superbrothers/kubectl-view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig-plugin/releases). Simply place the binary under `/usr/local/bin/`.\n\nAdditionally in order to install **helm**, follow the (instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)\nand set up completion by executing hte following:\n```bash\nhelm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm\n```\n\n## Service Account\n\nCreate the following YAML files, that contain the definition for the service account and its\nrole binding:\n- **`service_account.yml`**\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n```\n- **`role_binding.yml`**\n```yaml\nkind: RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <Binding Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: <Account Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: edit\n```\n\nApply both in sequence:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f service_account.yml\nkubectl apply -f role_binding.yml\n```\n\n### User Secret\n\nFor Kubernetes versions over 1.24 when creating a service account it's secret is not automatically created\nand mounted, so in that case create the following secret:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: <Account Secret Name>\n  namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: <Account Name>\ntype: kubernetes.io/service-account-token\n```\n\nExecute the following to get the new users config. If the plugin is not available the config must be constructed manually:\n```\nkubectl view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig -n <RAN.AI Namespace> <Account Name> > <User's Home>/.kube/config\n```\n\nFor reference the config looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nclusters:\n- cluster:\n    certificate-authority-data: ...\n    server: https://<Server>:<Port>\n  name: <Cluster Name>\ncontexts:\n- context:\n    cluster: <Cluster Name>\n    namespace: <RAN.AI Namespace>\n    user: <Account Name>\n  name: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\ncurrent-context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes\nkind: Config\npreferences: {}\nusers:\n- name: <Account Name>\n  user:\n    token: ...\n```\nIn the above segment `certificate-authority-data` and `token` can be obtained by executing:\n```bash\n# Find the Account's Secret Token name\nkubectl get secrets -n <RAN.AI Namespace>\n\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}'\nkubectl get -n <RAN.AI Namespace> secret <Account Secret Token> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode\n```\n# GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords\n\n- [GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords](#groupnet---change-bind-users-passwords)\n  - [RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind](#ranai-geolocation---t1-svc-cneranaibind)\n  - [R-Studio Connect - t1-svc-cnebind](#r-studio-connect---t1-svc-cnebind)\n    - [Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect)\n\nThe purpose of this document is to describe the procedure on how to change the passwords for the bind users used for querying the LDAP of GROUPNET domain.\n\n## RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind\n\n1.

Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\n    ``` bash\n    vi  /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg\n    # Update **BindPassword** with the password obtained in step 3 and save\n    ```\n\n5. Restart R-Studio Connect\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl restart rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n6. Check R-Studio Connect status\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n7. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n8. Due to the fact that the server is not directly connected to the Internet, R-Studio Connect might display an error about expired license after the reboot. In this case follow the steps listed [below](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect).\n9. Inform users that the application is available.\n\n### Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect\n\n1. Login to `unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr` as root via Cyberark\n2. Ensure that time is accurate and the time zone is correct for the machine.\n\n    ```bash\n    timedatectl\n    ```\n\n3. Sync date and time to hardware clock of the machine.\n\n    ``` bash\n    hwclock -w\n    ```\n\n4. Deactivate license\n\n    ``` bash\n    export http_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    export https_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager deactivate\n    ```\n\n5.

Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n\n### Check signed certificates from mno\n\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\n\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\n\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n\n- Check the issuer\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n\n- Check the subject\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n\n- Check the TLS Web\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n\n- Check the dates\n\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n\n - Or with a for loop for all the files\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n\n\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\n\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder : `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\n\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n\n\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- \n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\n with the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nwith the certificate from \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 `cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \n\nand copy the section\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\n\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n\n#### Check new certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n\n#### Haproxy certificates\n\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n\n**Special caution**:\n\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\n\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\n\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n\n```\n\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\n\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\n\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nsystemctl status cloudera-scm-agent\nsystemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent \n```\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\"\n```\n \n```\ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server\" \ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-server\"\n```\n\n### Kudu Checks\n\nOpen UIs from masters and tablets from internal firefox from edge nodes. Firefox launced with your personal Exxx account.\n\nLogs from kudu logs on every node:\n\n`tail -f /var/log/kudu/kudu-tserver.INFO` checks that the number will be equal to this number => `ls /u12/kudu/tablet/data/data/ | grep metadata | wc -l`, when the synchronization is successfully completed.\n\n\n\n#### Start flows\n",

The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n# Streamsets\n\n**Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`  \n**User:** `sdc`  \n**[Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)**   \n**Logs:** `/shared/sdc/log/sdc.log`  \n**Log Retention:** `10 days`  \n**Configuration:** `/shared/sdc/configuration/pipelines.properties`  \n**Streamsets:** `https://un2.bigdata.abc.gr:18636`  \n**Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n\n## Streamsets Flows\n\n`Streamsets Flows` are used for getting files from sftp remdef resources, processing them, storing them into HDFS directories and loading the file data into Hive and Impala tables.

        "retrieved_context": "# Method of Procedure (MoP) - AppEmptyQueryException Alerts Resolution\n\n## Description\nThis MoP document outlines the resolution steps for addressing AppEmptyQueryException alerts related to missing data from bigcust tables. The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.",

Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n\n## Decommission\n\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary. From it, check for any custom, non-default IP partitions.\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# sminfo\nsminfo: sm lid 15 sm guid 0x10e0406d5aa0a0, activity count 26263191 priority 14 state 3 SMINFO_MASTER\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ibnetdiscover | grep 10e0406d5aa0a0\nswitchguid=0x10e0406d5aa0a0(10e0406d5aa0a0)\nSwitch 36 \"S-0010e0406d5aa0a0\" # \"SUN DCS 36P QDR bdax01sw-ib1 xxx.xxx.171.24\" enhanced port 0 lid 15 lmc 0\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ssh root@xxx.xxx.171.24\n\n[root@bda01sw-ib1 ~]# smpartition list active\n# Sun DCS IB partition config file\n# This file is generated, do not edit\n#! version_number : 0\nDefault=0x7fff, ipoib : ALL_CAS=full, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full;\nSUN_DCS=0x0001, ipoib : ALL_SWITCHES=full;\n\nIf there are IB partitions other than default partitions, then refer to MOS ndef 1985159.1 for additional steps that will need to be taken before the old HCA is removed.\n```\n- [MOS ndef 1985159.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=SrDetailText&sourceId=3-37179888534&id=1985159.1)\n\nIf `smpartition list active` shows output similar to the above, no actions are needed. If not the attached procedure must followed in order to replace the UUIDs.\n\n## Fix Interface\n\nOracle runs an automated configuration scripts that sets arp checking of the gateway in certain interfaces. If\nthe interfaces are non-routable, as is the case for bondeth1 and bondeth2, these options must be removed.\n\n1. Check for any interfaces that should not be in the DOWN state with `ip a`\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove\n   any option not present in the known-good node. Generally these would be options referring to ARP.\n4. Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n\n## Recommission\n\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n\nAfter everything is back online the kudu tablet on the host might not have taken on any tablets. This\nis normal as all tablets have been replicated to the other hosts. With time it will take on tablets as\nwell.\n\nThis can be verified using `ksck` as the kudu user.",

        "retrieved_context": "# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\n\n    Example for day 20220501:\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 20230104 \"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\"\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n\n    1.

        "retrieved_context": "# Benchmarking HBASE on Lab with YCSB Tool\n\n## Introduction\n\nOur purpose was to run performance tests on a created Hbase table on Lab environment and document the results which will be used as a point of reference to evaluate the efficacy of quotas that will be applied. After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n\n## Hbase table creation\n\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n- Set throttle quotas of type 'read'\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => READ, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'read'\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_read_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Remove read quotas and set write quotas\n\n- Remove read quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => NONE\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n- Set write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    set_quota TYPE => THROTTLE, THROTTLE_TYPE => WRITE, NAMESPACE => 'quotas_test', LIMIT => '20req/sec'\n    list_quotas\n    ```\n-  Delete and recreate table to repeat to run tests with write quotas\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n    n_splits = 300\n    create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n    ```\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB after setting quotas of type 'write'\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table='quotas_test:usertable' -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada_write_quotas.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  drop 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  exists 'quotas_test:usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'quotas_test:usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n**References:**\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB#ycsb\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/hbase2\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload\n\nhttps://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads\n\nhttps://blog.cloudera.com/hbase-performance-testing-using-ycsb/\n# Manage HBase Quotas\n\n## Enable HBase quotas\n1.

Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf it is not been imported, you should import them using formula  `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain so we can verify that the change is succesfully made. \nVaggos username in our case (enomikos)\n3. Customer should also send a bind user that we will use for groupnet domain configuration.\n4. `/etc/hosts` file at `un5` must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n5. Perfom an ldap search for the given bind user. \n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=enomikos)'\n```\n\n\n### Backup\n\n1.

Back up `ldap_authorizations.xml`:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# cp -ap /usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations.xml /usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations-central.xml\n```\n\n3. Back up haproxy:\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.bak\n```\n\n\n### Actions \n\n1. Login to `https://cne.def.gr/SpagoBI` with the credentials you have and create groupnet user for user `enomikos`:\n- User Management\n- Click on **Add**\n- Fill in with the user ID and full name\n- Add roles\n- Save\n\n2. Verify that the user is successfully created using following commands:\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u spagobi -p;\nmysql> use spagobi;\nmysql> show tables;\nmysql> select * FROM SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID='enomikos@groupnet';\n```\n\n3. Stop SpagoBI process:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# docker stop prod-spagobi-7.0.105\n```\n\n4. Edit the following lines at `un5:/usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations.xml`:\n\n```bash\n<!--  SERVER -->\n                <HOST>un1.bigdata.abc.gr</HOST>\n                <PORT>863</PORT>        \n                <ADMIN_USER>replace_with_name_of_admin</ADMIN_USER>\n                <ADMIN_PSW>replace_with_password</ADMIN_PSW> <!-- password in clear text -->\n                <BASE_DN>dc=groupnet,dc=gr</BASE_DN> <!-- base domain, if any -->\n```\n\n5. Update reverse proxy at `un1` so that Groupnet AD can be reached directly from spagobi app.\n\nAdd the following at `un1:/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`\n\n```bash\nlisten def-ad-ldaps\n    bind *:863 ssl crt /opt/security/haproxy/node.pem\n    mode tcp\n    balance     source\n    server def_ad1 PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636 ssl check ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\n```\n\n6. Test and reload haproxy in order changes to take effect\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -c\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl reload haproxy\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl status haproxy\n```\n\n7. Start SpagoBI app:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# docker start prod-spagobi-7.0.105\n```\n\n8. Check if `enomikos` can sign in. If yes, then go to the next step\n9. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\nmysql> use spagobi;\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%'; #check existing users that belong to central-domain\nUPDATE SBI_USER SET USER_ID = REPLACE(USER_ID,'@central-domain','@groupnet') WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%';\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%'; #check that no user left to central-domain\n```\n\n> Ndef: Before moving all users at once to the new domain you can first test just one.

For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6.

        "chatbot_answer": " To modify SSL settings in Apache, Nginx, and HAProxy, follow these steps:\n\n### Apache\n\n1.  Open the Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf` or `apache2.conf`) in a text editor.\n2.  Locate the `<VirtualHost>` block that corresponds to the site you want to configure.\n3.  Add the following lines within the `<VirtualHost>` block:\n    *   `SSLEngine on`\n    *   `SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/cert.crt`\n    *   `SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your/private.key`\n4.  Save the changes to the configuration file.\n5.  Restart the Apache service to apply the changes.\n\n### Nginx\n\n1.  Open the Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) in a text editor.\n2.  Locate the `server` block that corresponds to the site you want to configure.\n3.  Add the following lines within the `server` block:\n    *   `listen 443 ssl;`\n    *   `ssl_certificate /path/to/your/cert.crt;`\n    *   `ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;`\n4.  Save the changes to the configuration file.\n5.  Restart the Nginx service to apply the changes.\n\n### HAProxy\n\n1.  Open the HAProxy configuration file (`haproxy.cfg`) in a text editor.\n2.  Locate the `frontend` or `backend` block that corresponds to the site you want to configure.\n3.  Add the following lines within the `frontend` or `backend` block:\n    *   `bind :443 ssl crt /path/to/your/cert.crt`\n4.  Save the changes to the configuration file.\n5.  Restart the HAProxy service to apply the changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can modify the SSL settings in Apache, Nginx, and HAProxy to ensure secure communication between your server and clients.",

Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n\n### Check signed certificates from mno\n\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\n\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\n\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n\n- Check the issuer\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n\n- Check the subject\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n\n- Check the TLS Web\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n\n- Check the dates\n\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n\n - Or with a for loop for all the files\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n\n\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\n\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder : `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\n\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n\n\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- \n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\n with the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nwith the certificate from \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 `cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \n\nand copy the section\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\n\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n\n#### Check new certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n\n#### Haproxy certificates\n\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n\n**Special caution**:\n\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\n\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\n\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n\n```\n\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\n\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\n\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nsystemctl status cloudera-scm-agent\nsystemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent \n```\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\"\n```\n \n```\ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server\" \ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-server\"\n```\n\n### Kudu Checks\n\nOpen UIs from masters and tablets from internal firefox from edge nodes. Firefox launced with your personal Exxx account.\n\nLogs from kudu logs on every node:\n\n`tail -f /var/log/kudu/kudu-tserver.INFO` checks that the number will be equal to this number => `ls /u12/kudu/tablet/data/data/ | grep metadata | wc -l`, when the synchronization is successfully completed.\n\n\n\n#### Start flows\n\nStart ibank from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n\nStart ibank visible from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_VISIBLE_STABLE.sh\n```\n \nStart online from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n\nSimilarly from a DR edge node as DEVREST:\n\nStart ibank\n\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\n\nStart online\n\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\n\n### Applications checks\n\nWhen all Kudu Tablets are synchronized and **all flows are on RUNNING status** then:\n \nas user PRODREST from an edge node:\n```\nimpala-shell xr1edge.mno.gr -k -ssl\n```\n\nExecute the following query:\n\n```\nselect max(timestamp) as time, 'ibank' as application from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream union select max(timestamp) as time, 'online' as application from prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream;\n```\n# Monitoring application\n[[_TOC_]]\n\n## Scope",

        "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
        "ground_truth": "1. Stop Wildfly:\n```bash\nsupervisorctl stop wildfly-prodrestib\n```\n2. Install the new Java version:\n```bash\nsudo yum install java-11-openjdk\n```\n3. Update the JAVA_HOME variable:\n```bash\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk\n```\n4. Restart Wildfly:\n```bash\nsupervisorctl start wildfly-prodrestib\n```",
        "chatbot_answer": "\n\n\n\n## Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the current Java version**: Before upgrading, it's essential to know the current Java version running on the server. This information can be obtained by running the command `java -version` in the terminal.\n\n2. **Check Wildfly compatibility with the new Java version**: It's crucial to ensure that the new Java version is compatible with the existing Wildfly installation. This information can be found in the Wildfly documentation or by contacting the Wildfly support team.\n\n3. **Stop the Wildfly service**: Before upgrading Java, it's necessary to stop the Wildfly service to prevent any potential conflicts or issues during the upgrade process. The command to stop the Wildfly service is `sudo systemctl stop wildfly` (for systemd-based systems) or `sudo service wildfly stop` (for non-systemd based systems).\n\n4. **Upgrade Java**: Once the Wildfly service is stopped, it's safe to proceed with upgrading Java.

        "retrieved_context": "# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\n\n    Example for day 20220501:\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 20230104 \"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\"\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\n\n        ``` sql\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\n        \"Terminated-Oracle\" state,\n        \"Closed\" problem_status,\n        case when clearancereportflag = \"1\" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\n        handledby as handled_by,\n        closedby as closed_by,\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\n        null previous_state,\n        managedobject as managed_object,\n        targetentities as target_entities,\n        --targetentities60512 as target_entities,\n        alarmtype as alarm_type,\n        eventtime as event_time,\n        probablecause as probable_cause,\n        securityalarmcause as security_alarm_cause,\n        specificproblems as specific_problems,\n        --specificproblems (id)-8eloume to join kai edw,\n        null backed_up_status,\n        backupobject as backup_object,\n        trendindication as trend_indication,\n        thresholdinfo as threshold_info,\n        cast(notificationidentifier as bigint) notification_identifier,\n        correlnotifinfo as correl_notif_info,\n        monitoredattributes as monitored_attributes,\n        proposedrepairactions as proposed_repair_actions,\n        null additional_information,\n        domain as domain,\n        securityalarmdetector as security_Alarm_Detector,\n        null service_User,\n        null service_Provider,\n        ocname as oc_Name,\n        cast(parentalarmobject as bigint) parent_alarm_object,\n        null severity_changed_time_stamp,\n        alarmcomment as alarm_comment,\n        agentalarmidentifier as agent_alarm_identifier,\n        agententity as agent_entity,\n        perceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\n        0 useridentifier,\n        usertext as user_Text,\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\n        null deleted,\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\n        --,*\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\n        ```\n\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \n\n    1.

Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\n\nServer:\n\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nUseful info:\n\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n\n### Update configuration\n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\n\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n\n3. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n# How to change Openldap Manager password\n\nFor every ldasearch the password of `Manager` is [here](KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n1. Login into kerb1 node as root:\n\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\n\n2. Use command-line in order to create a  slapd password\n\n```bash\nslappasswd -h {SSHA}\n```\n\n3. Store the output which will be start like `{SSHA}xxxxxxx` \n\n4. Create ldif files change password\n\na.\n\n```bash\nvi changepwconfig.ldif\n\ndn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: olcRootPW\nolcRootPW: paste the output from step `3`\n```\nb.\n\n```bash\nvi changepwmanager.ldif\n\ndn: olcDatabase={2}bdb,cn=config\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: olcRootPW\nolcRootPW: paste the output from step `3`\n```\n\n5.

This can only be done by manually triggering the workflow. Before doing so, you need to make some checks first:\n\n### Check workflow logs\n\n1. Login to https://999.999.999.999:8888/hue/accounts/login?next=/hue using the brond account\n2. Go to \"Jobs\" > \"Workflows\"\n\nIf all workflow executions (\"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\") were successful, you can proceed by checking that the file(s)\nabc added, were copied after the scheduled timings of the workflow\n\n### Check added files\n\nsftp get raw files (*.csv.gz) from FTP Server to `/data/1/brond_dsl_stats_LZ`\n```\necho \"ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\" | sftp bigd@999.999.999.999\nsftp> ls -l ADSL_Brond_DWH\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150589497 Nov 29 05:34 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.329_2022_11_29.csv.gz.LOADED\n-rw-r--r--    0 507      500      150823890 Nov 29 13:21 ADSL_Brond_DWH/DWH_VDSL.330_2022_11_29.csv.gz\n```\n\nThe second file was indeed added after the scheduled time and has not been picked up by the workflow.\n\n### Trigger workflow\n\nYou can now proceed to manually trigger the workflow:\n\n1. Go to HUE and select \"Jobs\"\n2. Go to \"Workflow\" and select \"Brond_Load_Retrains_WF_NEW\"\n3. In the next screen, select \"Rerun\"\n4. Wait for the workflow to successfully end\n5.

Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n\n### Update configuration\n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\n\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n\n3.

Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n# GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords\n\n- [GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords](#groupnet---change-bind-users-passwords)\n  - [RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind](#ranai-geolocation---t1-svc-cneranaibind)\n  - [R-Studio Connect - t1-svc-cnebind](#r-studio-connect---t1-svc-cnebind)\n    - [Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect)\n\nThe purpose of this document is to describe the procedure on how to change the passwords for the bind users used for querying the LDAP of GROUPNET domain.\n\n## RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind\n\n1. Inform users that the authentication with GROUPNET accounts may encounter errors during the procedure (approximate 1 hour). No pod will be restarted.\n2. Go to [https://cne.def.gr/auth/admin](https://cne.def.gr/auth/admin)\n3. Login with an administrative account\n4. Navigate to User Federation > GROUPNET\n5. Request password update `t1-svc-cneranaibind` via Remedy and obtain the new password\n6. Update `Bind Credential` field and press `Save`\n7. Press `Test authentication`\n\n## R-Studio Connect - t1-svc-cnebind\n\n1. Inform users for downtime of approximate 1 hour\n2. Login to `unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr` as root via Cyberark\n3. Request password update `t1-svc-cnebind` via Remedy and obtain the new password\n4. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\n    ``` bash\n    vi  /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg\n    # Update **BindPassword** with the password obtained in step 3 and save\n    ```\n\n5. Restart R-Studio Connect\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl restart rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n6. Check R-Studio Connect status\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n7. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n8. Due to the fact that the server is not directly connected to the Internet, R-Studio Connect might display an error about expired license after the reboot. In this case follow the steps listed [below](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect).\n9. Inform users that the application is available.\n\n### Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect\n\n1. Login to `unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr` as root via Cyberark\n2. Ensure that time is accurate and the time zone is correct for the machine.\n\n    ```bash\n    timedatectl\n    ```\n\n3. Sync date and time to hardware clock of the machine.\n\n    ``` bash\n    hwclock -w\n    ```\n\n4. Deactivate license\n\n    ``` bash\n    export http_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    export https_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager deactivate\n    ```\n\n5. Activate license\n\n    ``` bash\n    export http_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    export https_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager activate <product-key>\n    # This should display Activation status as Activated \n    ```\n\n6. In case you  receive the following\n\n   ``` text\n   Error activating product key: (13): The activation has expired or the system time has been tampered with. Ensure your time, timezone, and date settings are correct. If you're sure the license is not expired, try performing the following steps, in order: \n   1. Fix the timezone on your system.\n   2. Fix the date on your system.\n   3. Fix the time on your system.\n   4. Perform a system restart (important!)\n   ```\n\n   Fix any time/date issues and **reboot the server**.\n\n7. Verify license status\n\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager status\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager verify\n    ```\n\n8. Restart R-Studio Connect\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl restart rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n9. Check R-Studio Connect status\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n10. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n# abc - [One Domain] SpagoBI integration with GROUPNET\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users.\n\nServer to use: PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nProd Server: un5.bigdata.abc.gr\nURL: https://cne.def.gr/SpagoBI\n999.999.999.999 cne.def.gr cne\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf it is not been imported, you should import them using formula  `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain so we can verify that the change is succesfully made. \nVaggos username in our case (enomikos)\n3. Customer should also send a bind user that we will use for groupnet domain configuration.\n4. `/etc/hosts` file at `un5` must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n5. Perfom an ldap search for the given bind user. \n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=enomikos)'\n```\n\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Backup spagobi mysql database:\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysqldump -u root -p spagobi --single-transaction > /tmp/spagobi.sql\n```\n\n2. Back up `ldap_authorizations.xml`:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# cp -ap /usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations.xml /usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations-central.xml\n```\n\n3. Back up haproxy:\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.bak\n```\n\n\n### Actions \n\n1. Login to `https://cne.def.gr/SpagoBI` with the credentials you have and create groupnet user for user `enomikos`:\n- User Management\n- Click on **Add**\n- Fill in with the user ID and full name\n- Add roles\n- Save\n\n2. Verify that the user is successfully created using following commands:\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u spagobi -p;\nmysql> use spagobi;\nmysql> show tables;\nmysql> select * FROM SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID='enomikos@groupnet';\n```\n\n3. Stop SpagoBI process:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# docker stop prod-spagobi-7.0.105\n```\n\n4. Edit the following lines at `un5:/usr/lib/spagobi/webapps/SpagoBIProject/WEB-INF/conf/webapp/ldap_authorizations.xml`:\n\n```bash\n<!--  SERVER -->\n                <HOST>un1.bigdata.abc.gr</HOST>\n                <PORT>863</PORT>        \n                <ADMIN_USER>replace_with_name_of_admin</ADMIN_USER>\n                <ADMIN_PSW>replace_with_password</ADMIN_PSW> <!-- password in clear text -->\n                <BASE_DN>dc=groupnet,dc=gr</BASE_DN> <!-- base domain, if any -->\n```\n\n5. Update reverse proxy at `un1` so that Groupnet AD can be reached directly from spagobi app.\n\nAdd the following at `un1:/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`\n\n```bash\nlisten def-ad-ldaps\n    bind *:863 ssl crt /opt/security/haproxy/node.pem\n    mode tcp\n    balance     source\n    server def_ad1 PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636 ssl check ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\n```\n\n6. Test and reload haproxy in order changes to take effect\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -c\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl reload haproxy\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl status haproxy\n```\n\n7.

Set up the HAProxy configuration on the incelligent node.\n    2. Configure the DNS entries for the Kafka brokers.\n    3. Start the HAProxy service and verify that it is working correctly.\n\n    By following these steps, you can establish a connection between Viavi's Kafka cluster and BigStreamer's datanodes. This will enable the development of applications that utilize the data from Viavi's Kafka cluster. ```\n\n\n## Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **Identify the failed step**: Use the alarm name to identify which step has failed.\n2. **Check the logs for errors**: Look at the script logs, sqoop logs, and Impala logs to find any error messages that might indicate what went wrong.\n3. **Verify data counts**: If the failure is related to data migration or insertion, check the counts of records in the source and target tables to ensure they match.\n4. **Check for external system issues**: If the problem involves communication with an external system (like MSSQL), verify that the issue is not with the external system itself.\n\n## Fixed solution:\nThe fixed solution would depend on the specific step that failed and the root cause of the failure. However, here are some general steps that could be taken to fix the issues:\n\n1. **Re-run the failed script**: If the problem was temporary or if you cannot determine the root cause of the problem, try to re-run the failed application.\n2. **Check and adjust the configuration files**: Make sure that all configuration files (like HAProxy configuration, DNS entries, etc.) are correctly set up and adjusted according to the specific requirements of your system.\n3. **Verify data integrity**: After fixing the issue, make sure to verify the data integrity by checking the counts of records in the source and target tables.\n\n## Explanation of changes:\nThe explanation of changes would depend on the specific step that failed and the root cause of the failure. However, here are some general explanations of changes that could be made:\n\n1. **Re-running the failed script**: If the problem was temporary or if you cannot determine the root cause of the problem, re-running the failed application can resolve the issue.\n2. **Adjust",

Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n\n### Check signed certificates from mno\n\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\n\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\n\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n\n- Check the issuer\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n\n- Check the subject\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n\n- Check the TLS Web\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n\n- Check the dates\n\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n\n - Or with a for loop for all the files\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n\n\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\n\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder : `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\n\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n\n\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- \n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\n with the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nwith the certificate from \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 `cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \n\nand copy the section\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\n\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n\n#### Check new certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n\n#### Haproxy certificates\n\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n\n**Special caution**:\n\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\n\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\n\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n\n```\n\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\n\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy. Restart is required. [Official Guide](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/6/6.3/topics/cm_mc_start_stop_service.html)\nAll services except zookeeper need restart. The service `Bigdatamanager` should always remain stopped \nWe prefer to start with Kudu because it takes longer to synchronize. Also, for KMS service perform restart 1 by 1. For KMS server perform restart on both passive services and then on both active.  \nLastlty, after Kudu syncs start the flows.\n\nWhen the cluster be stopped then:\n \nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nsystemctl status cloudera-scm-agent\nsystemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent \n```\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-agent\" \ndcli -C \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-agent | grep -i Active\"\n```\n \n```\ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl restart cloudera-scm-server\" \ndcli -c Xr1node03 \"systemctl status cloudera-scm-server\"\n```\n\n### Kudu Checks\n\nOpen UIs from masters and tablets from internal firefox from edge nodes. Firefox launced with your personal Exxx account.\n\nLogs from kudu logs on every node:\n\n`tail -f /var/log/kudu/kudu-tserver.INFO` checks that the number will be equal to this number => `ls /u12/kudu/tablet/data/data/ | grep metadata | wc -l`, when the synchronization is successfully completed.\n\n\n\n#### Start flows\n\nStart ibank from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n\nStart ibank visible from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_VISIBLE_STABLE.sh\n```\n \nStart online from edge Node as PRODREST\n \n```\n/opt/ingestion/PRODREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno_STABLE.sh\n```\n\nSimilarly from a DR edge node as DEVREST:\n\nStart ibank\n\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/ibank/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\n\nStart online\n\n```\n/opt/ingestion/DEVREST/online/spark/submit/submitmnoSparkTopology_stream_cluster_mno.sh\n```\n\n### Applications checks\n\nWhen all Kudu Tablets are synchronized and **all flows are on RUNNING status** then:\n \nas user PRODREST from an edge node:\n```\nimpala-shell xr1edge.mno.gr -k -ssl\n```\n\nExecute the following query:\n\n```\nselect max(timestamp) as time, 'ibank' as application from prod_trlog_ibank.service_audit_stream union select max(timestamp) as time, 'online' as application from prod_trlog_online.service_audit_stream;\n```",

Generally these would be options referring to ARP.\n4. Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n\n## Recommission\n\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n\nAfter everything is back online the kudu tablet on the host might not have taken on any tablets. This\nis normal as all tablets have been replicated to the other hosts. With time it will take on tablets as\nwell.\n\nThis can be verified using `ksck` as the kudu user.\n# Below procedure describes how to decrypt an encrypted disk\n\n\n###### Back up \nBackup data of encrypted disk\n\n>Ndef_1: In our case we don't have data in this partition. So, we don't have to backup\n\n```bash\ntar zcvf /backup/data_1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /data/1\n```\n\n###### Decrypt encrypted disk\n\n1.

In our case we don't have data so we skip this step\n\n- From Cloudera Manager > Kafka > Stop\n\n- From Cloudera Manager > Kudu > Stop\n\n2. Check that KTS is up and running\n\nFrom Cloudera Manager with admin account:\n\n- Go to Keytrustee > Key Trustee Server  \n\n3. Remove /data/1 mountpoint that is no longer in use\n```bash\nnavencrypt-prepare --undo-force /data/1\n```\n4. Check ztab:\n```bash\ncat /etc/navencrypt/ztab | grep /data/1\n```\nThe output should be commented \n\n5. List the mountpoints\n```bash\nmount -l\n```\n\n6. Uncomment the decrypted mount points on fstab\n\nUncomment line for `/dev/mapper/ol_pr1edge01-data_1 /data/1 xfs defauts 0 0` at `/etc/fstab`\n\n7.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n\n## Hbase table creation\n\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 #

        "retrieved_context": "[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\n\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n\n### Ingestion Endpoint\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n\n### Check application status\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n\n## Application Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`\n\nThe specific order in which they are called is the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[\"export_*_kpis.sh<br><i>IPVPN-SLA</i>\"] -->B[compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh]\nB -->C[query_sm.sh]\nC --/ingest-query-->D(SM Application)\nstyle A fill:darkgray\nstyle B fill:#ECECEC\nstyle C fill:#ECECEC\n```\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nStop/Start guide on [abc_BigStreamer_Apps_MoP_Restart.docx](https://ghi.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/abcBigData/EZsK97GxFyVHkeBoFTFjuRYBtPF7lK86cTA44wMhayNlNA?e=Gjh0ZO)  \nCheck project wiki [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#deployment-instructions)\n\n\n## SQM Token Authentication\nThe authentication on the SQM server is done with the HTTP Token Auth in IPVPN-SM application. It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n\n# Failure Handling\n## Logs\n\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\n\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n\n\n# Support\n\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### AppQueryIngestionException\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMAuthException\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\n\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\n\n1. In case we want perform the execution for just **one 5m interval**, we provide the same argument for `reference-start-time` and `reference-end-time` fields. E.g. for 5m period of 18/12/2022 10:10:\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181010\n```\n2. If we want to perform requests for **5 multiple consecutive** 5min intervals E.g. for 5m periods of 18/12/2022 10:10 to 10:30 (inclusive):\n\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181030\n```\nThe logs of this operation are appended to the log files in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`.\n[[_TOC_]]\n\n# IPVPN\nIP VPN is an application that receives metrics about the network quality for the abc VPN Customers and produces Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding Memory Usage, CPU Load, Provider Edge (PE) Interface, PE Branch Availability and PE Branch Quality of Service (QoS), which are collected and processed by the Service Management (SM) system of abc.\n\nThis is a document that will assist on support. Business documents can be found [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/tree/master/docs).\n\n## Input Performance Data\n\nThere are two source systems, HP Network Node Manager (NNM) and SNMP Custom Poller application, that poll periodically network elements and produces raw files with the instantenous metrics. These files are then parsed by one or more procedures. Finally they are loaded to BigStreamer cluster in Impala tables. There are 3 flows of input performance data that are being described in detail below.\n\n### Component Metrics\n\n#### Creation of raw files\n\nThe source system in this case is NNM. For high availability there are two instances of NNM on two seperate servers and they operate in active-standby fashion. The whole infrastructure is entirely managed by abc. The raw files produced contain component metrics for CPU load and memory usage of the network elements and are stored in local paths on those servers.\n\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Service: NNM <br> Host: nnmprd01.abc.gr] --> B[File: BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz <br> Path: /var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final <br> Host: nnmprd01.abc.gr]\n  C[Service: NNM <br> Host: nnmdis01.abc.gr] -.->|Stopped| D[File: BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_yyyymmddHHMMssSSS.csv.gz <br> Path: /var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final <br> Host: nnmdis01.abc.gr]\n```\n\n**Path**: `/var/opt/OV/shared/nnm/databases/custompoller/export/final` on `nnmprd01.abc.gr` or `nnmdis01.abc.gr`\n",

Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary.

We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C keytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias \\$HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n\n```\nFor edge nodes:\n\n```\nkeytool -import -file /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert -alias $HOSTNAME -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -keypass KEYSTORE_PASS_FROM_ABOVE -noprompt\n```\n\n#### Check new certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n \n```\ndcli -C \"keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias \\$HOSTNAME\"\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n \n```\nkeytool -list -v -keystore /opt/cloudera/security/jks/node.jks -alias $HOSTNAME\n```\n\n#### Haproxy certificates\n\nCopy the files from `/backup/haproxy_certs/` to `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` and replace the existing ones.\n\n**Special caution**:\n\nMust copy `Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem` that we created in the previous steps to the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate existing on the edge nodes\n\n```\ncp /backup/haproxy_certs/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr.node.haproxy.pem /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n**Do not copy root.inter.pem**\n\nAfter copying the certificates, restart the haproxy service on both edge nodes\n\n```\nsystemctl reload haproxy \nsystemctl status haproxy\npcs resource cleanup haproxy-clone`\n```\n\nIn case of an error that the node haproxy certificate is not valid after the restart, do the following :\n\n```\ncd /opt/cloudera/security/x509\ncat node.hue.key node.cert > /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem\n\n```\n\n### Actions After Distributing the certificates\n\nWhen the new certificates replace the old ones, the services of the cluster will become healthy.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\n# Streamsets\n\n**Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`  \n**User:** `sdc`  \n**[Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)**   \n**Logs:** `/shared/sdc/log/sdc.log`  \n**Log Retention:** `10 days`  \n**Configuration:** `/shared/sdc/configuration/pipelines.properties`  \n**Streamsets:** `https://un2.bigdata.abc.gr:18636`  \n**Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n\n## Streamsets Flows\n\n`Streamsets Flows` are used for getting files from sftp remdef resources, processing them, storing them into HDFS directories and loading the file data into Hive and Impala tables.

Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\n\nServer:\n\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nUseful info:\n\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n\n### Update configuration\n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\n\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n\n3. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n# Scope\n\nOnce a year the kubernetes certificates are expiring. In order to prevent that, we have a procedure below in which we are describing the steps that will help you to renew them.\n\n## Setup\n**Masters**: `kubemaster1`, `kubemaster2`, `kubemaster3`\n\n**Important ndef:** This procedure requires downtime.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLogin to kubemaster1.bigdata.abc.gr with your personal account and become root:\n\n- Check the certificates expiration date:\n \n    ```bash\n    sudo su -\n    \n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of kubernetes configuration to tmp \n    ```bash\n    cp -ar /etc/kubernetes /tmp/\n    ```\n\n- Keep a backup of incelligent service account\n\n```bash\ncp -ar /home/users/incelligent/.kube/config /tmp/bckup_renew_certificates/\n```\n\n- Renew the certificates\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm  certs renew all\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n    ```\n\n- Run the following\n    ```bash\n    cp -p /root/.kube/config /root/.kube/config_old\n    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf  /root/.kube/config\n    ```\n\n- From the newly create`/etc/admin/conf` make sure to copy the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` data content. After that, ` vi /home/users/incellignet/.kube/config` and replace the values you copied earlier in order to add the new certificates.\n\n- Check again the certificates expiration date\n    ```bash\n    kubeadm certs check-expiration\n   ```\n\n- Check the kubectl functionality\n    ```bash\n    kubectl get pods\n    ```\n\n- When the certificates of controller, apiserver and scheduler are renewed you must also stop containers of those three:\n\n```bash\nctrctl ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n1350c48cbfb5        b3c57ca578fb           \"kube-controller-man\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-controller-manager_kube-controller-manager-cti-cx1_kube-system_9eb854fb973ddd6df55fb792a2fbf743_9\n1bd22e95ef01        5a84bb672db8           \"kube-scheduler --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                           k8s_kube-scheduler_kube-scheduler-cti-cx1_kube-system_649aa160f1bd0840b2bb0f70b6493f99_9\ncf43799ae77d0       b6e18ffb844e6          \"kube-apiserver --au\u2026\"   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes                 \n```\n\nStop containers IDs:\n\n```bash\nctrctl stop 1350c48cbfb5 1bd22e95ef01 cf3cb7655b99d\n```\n\n> Ndef_1: Keep in mind that when the containers will be stopped, there will be downtime\n\n> Ndef_2: Keep in mind that those pods are static so you don't need to kill them. They will be automatically restarted\n\n- Also delete core-dns pod:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pod -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns\nNAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE\ncoredns-64897985d-7dzkl   1/1     Running   3 (84d ago)   644d\ncoredns-64897985d-rw5kc   1/1     Running   0             83d\n```\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete pod coredns-64897985d-7dzkl  coredns-64897985d-rw5kc  -n kube-system\n```\n\n- Repeat the same procedure for `kubemaster2` and `kubemaster3`\n\n\n> Ndef: incelligent user exists only at kubemaster1, so you dont have to to do actions for this users at kubemaster2 and kubemaster3\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\n\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n\n### Backup Procedure\n\n- From node1 as root:\n\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n\n```\n\n- From edge nodes as root:\n\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n\n### Check unsigned certificates\n\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\n\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n\nThen we provide to the customer the certificates located in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` in order to be signed\n\n### Check signed certificates from mno\n\nIn the following folder are located the signed certificates\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/new_certs/certificates`\n\nCheck the certificates in the above mentioned folder for issuer , subject ,TLS Web, date\n\nThe `'ln -1'` feature prints all files in the for loop per line\n\n- Check the issuer\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/issuer.JPG)\n\n- Check the subject\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i subject ; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/subject.JPG)\n\n- Check the TLS Web\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'TLS Web' ; done` \n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/tls.JPG)\n\n- Check the dates\n\n`openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert_file' - dates`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/dates.JPG)\n\n - Or with a for loop for all the files\n\n`for i in 'ln -1'; do openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i 'ndef after'; done`\n\nIn the above command we wait a return such as this: \n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/notafter.JPG)\n\n\n### Haproxy certificates check and replacement\n\nBackup NFS Folder: `/backup/haproxy_certs`\n\n`ssh root@pr1edge01`\n\nIn order to set the new haproxy certificates we need to have 9 certificates\nCheck the haproxy security folder : `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/`\n```\ndevsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\npr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\ndr1edge_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nqasqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\nprodsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem\n```\n\nand the node certifate for PR and DR in the following format \n`node.haproxy.pem`\n\n\n- Now in the NFS mentioned files we need to replace the second certificate with the one that is located in the signed cert files that the customer has send to us\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem` and replace the \n```\n--- BEGIN CERTIFICATE --- \n... \n--- END CERTIFICATE ---\n```\n with the one located in `/backup/new_certs/certificates/devsqla_mno_gr-cert-file.cer`\n\n- Moreover, as root replace the CERTIFICATE to the\n\n`vi /backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nwith the certificate from \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 `cat /backup/new_certs/certificates/devsql_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` \n\nand copy the section\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ---END CERTIFICATE---\n```\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and replace it with the certificate on the pem file `/backup/haproxy_certs/devsqla_mno_gr.haproxy.pem`\n\nFor all the other `pem` files we need to do the same procedure accordingly. **EVERY PEM HAS A UNIQUE CER FILE**\n\nWe need to specify in more detail the above steps especially for the 4 edge nodes we have on PR & DR sites.\n\n- Firstly, under `/opt/haproxy/security/x509/` folder there is the `node.haproxy.pem` certificate as mentioned before. We must copy this file under the NFS mentioned folder `/backup/haproxy_certs/`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncp /opt/haproxy/security/x509/node.haproxy.pem /backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem\n```\n\n- Then, from `/backup/haproxy_certs/Xredge0X.node.haproxy.pem` we must keep only the private key certificate section and replace the rest of the certificates with the ones that are located in the signed cert file `/backup/new_certs/certificates/Xr1edge0X_mno_gr-cert-file.cer` that the customer has send to us.\n\n- We must follow the same procedure for all edge nodes certificates.\n\n\n#### Checks\n- Check the issuer on previous certificates located in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`\n\n```\nca1.crt\nca.crt\nca3.crt\n```\n\n- Check the issuer in the above mentioned crt\n\n`for i in ca1.crt ca3.crt ca.crt; do echo $i; openssl x509 -noout -text -in $i | grep -i issuer; done`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/pki.JPG)\n\nFrom the above image we excepted to see the issuer as `mnoInternalRoot` which is correct in `ca3.crt`.\n\n- In order to check if the certificates has been signed from the same issuer. Run the following commands and check the output. It should be the same . If not, the certificate is wrong\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\nopenssl rsa -noout -modulus -in 'cert_file'\n```\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/x509.JPG)\n\n### Actions Before Distributing the certificates\n\nmno is obliged to move the traffic from PR site to DR site.\n\nStop the flows, as user PRODREST:\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_IBank_Ingest_Visible/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/PRODREST/service/PROD_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[PRODREST@Xr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep -i PROD_\n```\n\nWhen executing the same procedure on the DR site, we should **additionally** stop the following flows as user DEVREST:\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# touch SHUTDOWN\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_IBank_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# hdfs dfs \u2013put SHUTDOWN /user/DEVREST/service/DEV_Online_Ingest/topology_shutdown_marker/\n\n```\n\nCheck that flows stopped.\n\n```\n[DEVREST@dr1edge01]# yarn application \u2013list | grep DEVREST\n\n```\n## Distribute the certificates\n\n### Generate the keystore password (It's not the same for both sites)\n\n`bdacli getinfo cluster_https_keystore_password`\n\nFrom node01:\n\n#### Node certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```\ndcli -C cp /backup/new_certs/certificates/\\$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\nFor edge nodes:\n```\ncp /backup/new_certs/cert_2024/$HOSTNAME-cert-file.cer /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.cert\n```\n\n#### JKS certificates\n\nFor internal nodes:\n```",

Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**",

The log entries will provide details about each exported file, including the number of records (lines) in each file. This information allows you to verify and track the number of Location Mobility records being exported.\n\n    Additionally, if there are any discrepancies or issues with the export process, these log files can serve as a valuable resource for troubleshooting purposes. \n\n    Therefore, by examining the reconciliation log files, you can effectively verify the number of exported Location Mobility records and ensure that the data is being accurately processed and exported. \n```",

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n\n## Hbase table creation\n\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 #

        "ground_truth": "When multiple 'Impala Concurrent Client Connections' alarms appear, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the root cause by checking query logs in Cloudera.\n2. If queries are stalled, cancel them from `Cloudera > Impala > Queries`.\n3. Restart the Impala daemon on affected nodes.\n4. If the issue persists, analyze memory usage and consider redistributing workload across nodes.\nThese steps ensure that Impala recovers from heavy client loads and resumes processing efficiently.",
        "chatbot_answer": " To troubleshoot performance degradation in Impala caused by concurrent client connections, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Monitor Impala metrics**: Use tools like Cloudera Manager or Impala's built-in metrics to monitor the number of concurrent client connections, query execution times, and other relevant metrics.\n2. **Analyze query patterns**: Examine the types of queries being executed, including their complexity, data volume, and frequency. This can help identify potential bottlenecks or optimization opportunities.\n3. **Adjust Impala configuration**: Based on your analysis, adjust Impala's configuration settings to optimize performance for your specific use case. This may include adjusting settings like `num_nodes`, `query_pool_size`, or `mem_limit`.\n4. **Implement connection pooling**: To reduce the overhead of establishing and closing connections, consider implementing connection pooling using tools like Apache Hive's `hive.jdbc.pool` or Impala's built-in connection pooling.\n5. **Monitor and adjust**: Continuously monitor Impala's performance and adjust your configuration settings as needed to ensure optimal performance.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and optimize Impala's performance in the face of concurrent client connections.",
        "retrieved_context": "[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\n\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n\n### Ingestion Endpoint\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n\n### Check application status\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n\n## Application Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`\n\nThe specific order in which they are called is the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[\"export_*_kpis.sh<br><i>IPVPN-SLA</i>\"] -->B[compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh]\nB -->C[query_sm.sh]\nC --/ingest-query-->D(SM Application)\nstyle A fill:darkgray\nstyle B fill:#ECECEC\nstyle C fill:#ECECEC\n```\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nStop/Start guide on [abc_BigStreamer_Apps_MoP_Restart.docx](https://ghi.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/abcBigData/EZsK97GxFyVHkeBoFTFjuRYBtPF7lK86cTA44wMhayNlNA?e=Gjh0ZO)  \nCheck project wiki [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#deployment-instructions)\n\n\n## SQM Token Authentication\nThe authentication on the SQM server is done with the HTTP Token Auth in IPVPN-SM application. It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n\n# Failure Handling\n## Logs\n\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\n\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation. Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n\n\n# Support\n\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\n# Benchmarking HBASE on Lab with YCSB Tool\n\n## Introduction\n\nOur purpose was to run performance tests on a created Hbase table on Lab environment and document the results which will be used as a point of reference to evaluate the efficacy of quotas that will be applied. After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n\n## Hbase table creation\n\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n

How to fix openldap replication\n\nThe broken replication between `kerb1`/`kerb2` could happened in case any of the below cases appeared/happened.\n\n- Case 1: You changed the `Manager` password of openldap instance\n- Case 2: Replication broken for any other reason (power outage etc) between `kerb1` and `kerb2`\n\nFor every ldasearch the password of `Manager` is [here](KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n# For Case 1 follow the below steps:\n\nLogin into kerb1 node as root\n\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\nBackup:\n\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif\nslapcat -n 2 -l data.ldif\n```\nCreate ldif file replication fix\n\n```bash\nvi replication_config.ldif\n\ndn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config\nchangetype:modify\nreplace: olcSyncrepl\nolcSyncrepl: rid=001\n  provider=ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=config\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=\"new password\"\n  searchbase=\"cn=config\"\n  type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\nolcSyncrepl: rid=002\n  provider=ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr/\n  binddn=\"cn=config\"\n  bindmethod=simple\n  credentials=\"new

type=refreshAndPersist\n  retry=\"5 5 300 +\"\n  timeout=1\n\nadd: olcMirrorMode\nolcMirrorMode: TRUE\n```\n\nFix the replication:\n\n```bash\nldapmodify  -H ldaps://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=config\" -W -f replication_config.ldif\nldapmodify  -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=config\" -W -f replication_config.ldif\n```\n\nChecks:\n\nCreate a new user on ldap kerb1 via `UI` with name `testuser`:\n\nLogin into admin node as root:\n\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: (https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/)\n\n# Steps to create an ldap user\n\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3. Click `create a new entry here`\n4. The type of account will be `User account`\n5. Fill all the empty boxes. \n6. The user will be `no login` and the group/gid `disabled`\n7. Create object\n\nAfter succesfully creation of `testuser` check if exist on `kerb2` from the dropdown menu or via ldapsearch\n\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=testuser'\n```\n\nIf user exist then replication fixed. Just delete the `testuser`.\n\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3. Check the new user and from the right bar click `delete this entry`\n\n\n# For Case 2 follow the below steps:\n\nIdentify which `kerb` ldap instance has the issue. For example check if they had the same ammount of `users` and `groups` with `ldapsearch` commands from checks\n\nFrom the `kerb` ldap instance without corruption :\n\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0  config.ldif\nslapcat -n 1 data.ldif\n\nscp *.ldif `ldap_instance_with_corruption`:/tmp\n```\nGo to corrupted `kerb` instance:\n\nBackup:\n```bash\ncp -rp /etc/openldap/ /tmp/openldap.bak\ncp -rp /var/lib/ldap/ /tmp\n```\n\nClear:\n```bash\nsystemctl stop slapd\nsystemctl status slapd\ncd /etc/openldap/\nrm \u2013Rf slapd.d\ncd /etc/openldap\nmkdir slapd.d\ncd /var/lib/ldap/\nrm \u2013Rf *\n```\nRestore:\n```bash\nslapadd -n 0 -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -l /tmp/config.ldif\nslapadd -n 2 -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -l /tmp/data.ldif -w\n```\nOwnership:\n```bash\nchown -R ldap:ldap /var/lib/ldap\n```\nStart `slapd` service:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start slapd\nsystemctl status slapd\n```\n\nChecks:\n\nCreate a new user on ldap kerb1 via `UI` with name `testuser`:\n\nThe procedure to create a new user described [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/openldap_change_manager_password.md)\n\nLogin into admin node as root:\n\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: (https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/)\n\nAfter succesfully creation of `testuser` check if exist on `kerb2` from the dropdown menu or via ldapsearch\n\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=testuser'\n```\n\nIf user exist then replication fixed. Just delete the `testuser`.\n\nThe procedure to delete a new user described [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/openldap_change_manager_password.md)\n# Certificate Renewal Procedure\n\nBack up every certificate before doing any action\n\n### Backup Procedure\n\n- From node1 as root:\n\n``` \ndcli -C \"cp -r /opt/cloudera/security /opt/cloudera/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\" \n\n```\n\n- From edge nodes as root:\n\n```\ncp -r /opt/haproxy/security /opt/haproxy/security.BAK_`date +%d%b%Y%H%M%S`\n```\n\n## Node and VIP Certificates check\n\n### Check unsigned certificates\n\n- In this step we checked the presigned certificates in `backup/new_certs/cert_requests` if they have correct subject with the following command\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/certreq.JPG)\n\nand also we check the modulus if it is the same. Basically we check the output of the following commands:\n\n`openssl rsa -in /opt/cloudera/security/x509/node.key -noout -text modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus1.JPG)\n\n`openssl req -in new_certs/cert_requests/dr1edge.mno.gr-ert-file -noout -text -modulus`\n\n![alt text](KnowledgeBase/mno/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/media/modulus2.JPG)\n",

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

        "retrieved_context": "# Energy-Efficiency Pollaploi\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is an `Oozie Flow` responsible to **load data** from **txt files** into **impala tables**. Through the **Oozie Workflow** a **ssh** action is performed which executes the `pollaploi.sh` script. \n\n- **Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - [Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)\n  - **Main File Directory:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/`\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `intra`\n  - **Coordinator:** `coord_energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n    - **Execution:** \n      - **Winter time:** `every day at 21:00 local time (9PM)`\n      - **Daylight saving time:** `every day at 22:00 local time (10PM)`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `8 seconds`\n    - **Workflow:** `energy_efficiency_load_pollaploi`\n      - **SSH Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `intra2`\n      - [Script](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/PROD/load_pollaploi/pollaploi/pollaploi.sh)\n      - **Logs:** `view through job run - NO LOGS`\n\n## Pollaploi Flow\n\nThe `pollaploi flow` gets a .txt file from a remdef sftp directory and moves it to a temporary directory on the utility node. Then it unzips the file that was just transferred and compares it to another.txt file in the curr directory on the utility node. If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**\n#check Retention\nlogin @un2 as intra\n1st level:\n$ grep \"Script Status\" /shared/abc/cdo/log/203.Retention_Dynamic_Drop_DDL.202012.log | tail -n1\n\n\u03c0.\u03c7.

The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**",

        "retrieved_context": "[[_TOC_]]\n# Introduction\nThis support document outlines the steps that compose the IPVPN-SM replacement process that computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the network quality of abc. The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\n\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n\n### Ingestion Endpoint\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`.

Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`\n\nThe specific order in which they are called is the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[\"export_*_kpis.sh<br><i>IPVPN-SLA</i>\"] -->B[compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh]\nB -->C[query_sm.sh]\nC --/ingest-query-->D(SM Application)\nstyle A fill:darkgray\nstyle B fill:#ECECEC\nstyle C fill:#ECECEC\n```\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nStop/Start guide on [abc_BigStreamer_Apps_MoP_Restart.docx](https://ghi.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/abcBigData/EZsK97GxFyVHkeBoFTFjuRYBtPF7lK86cTA44wMhayNlNA?e=Gjh0ZO)  \nCheck project wiki [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#deployment-instructions)\n\n\n## SQM Token Authentication\nThe authentication on the SQM server is done with the HTTP Token Auth in IPVPN-SM application. It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n\n# Failure Handling\n## Logs\n\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2.

Details about the logging of IPVPN-SLA can be found [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### Auto-retry mechanism\nDuring the schedules runs, if the call to the IPVPN-SM app fails, the call to the application is repeated. If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n\n\n# Support\n\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### AppQueryIngestionException\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMAuthException\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\n\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\n\n1. In case we want perform the execution for just **one 5m interval**, we provide the same argument for `reference-start-time` and `reference-end-time` fields. E.g. for 5m period of 18/12/2022 10:10:\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181010\n```\n2. If we want to perform requests for **5 multiple consecutive** 5min intervals E.g. for 5m periods of 18/12/2022 10:10 to 10:30 (inclusive):\n\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181030\n```\nThe logs of this operation are appended to the log files in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`.\n# Monitoring application\n[[_TOC_]]\n\n## Scope\nThe purpose of application is to monitor all streamming and batch jobs through HTTP calls.
