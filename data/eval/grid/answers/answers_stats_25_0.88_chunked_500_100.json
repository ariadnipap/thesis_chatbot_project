The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n```\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n`select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.",

Then, verify the renewal by checking the expiration dates again with `kubeadm certs check-expiration`.\n\n6. **Update kubeconfig**: Update the `kubeconfig` file to use the new certificates. This involves copying the new admin configuration to your user directory: `cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config`. Ensure you have the correct permissions and that the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set correctly if you are using a custom location for your `kubeconfig` file.\n\n7. **Update Intelligent Service Account Configuration**: Update the intelligent service account configuration with the new certificates. This involves editing the `~/.kube/config` file for the intelligent service account and replacing the old certificate data with the new data obtained from the renewed certificates.\n\n8. **Restart affected services**: After renewing the certificates, you need to restart the affected Kubernetes services (e.g., controller-manager, scheduler) to ensure they pick up the new certificates.\n\n9. **Verify functionality**: Finally, verify that all Kubernetes components are functioning correctly with the new certificates by running commands like `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl get pods -A`, and checking the logs of system components for any errors related to certificate validation or connectivity issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully renew your Kubernetes certificates for RAN.AI.

        "chatbot_response": " To configure Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer, you need to set up HAProxy configuration and manage DNS entries. The setup involves adding new IPs to the Incelligent node, assigning hostnames from the Kafka Brokers to these internal IPs, and creating DNS entries on the cluster's internal DNS. Additionally, you need to configure the application by updating the `translogApiOnlineJmxConfig.xml` file located at `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/`. \n\n    Please note that this is a complex process and requires careful planning and execution to ensure successful connectivity between Viavi Kafka and BigStreamer. \n\n    Also, it's important to monitor the application logs and access logs to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during or after the configuration process. The application logs are located at `/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/server.log`, and the access logs are located at `/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/access.log`. \n\n    By following these steps and monitoring the logs, you should be able to successfully configure Viavi Kafka connectivity with BigStreamer. \n\n    Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
