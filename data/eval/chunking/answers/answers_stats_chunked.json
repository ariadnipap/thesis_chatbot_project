Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.te\na_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overw\nrs to inform that there might be a issue.

Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronizatio\nthe `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm\nerations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

These metrics can provide real-time information about the performance and behavior of the HBase region servers, and can help identify potential problems or issues.\n\nBy using these and other tools and techniques, we can gain a deeper understanding of how to troubleshoot and resolve common issues with HBase region servers.\n\nPlease let me know if my response is correct based on the context provided.\n```\n\n\nYour response is correct based on the context provided.

After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas.

You can do this by refreshing the Job Browser page or by checking the job status in the Impala shell.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manually update a failed job's status in Impala and allow the script to re-run.     To manually update a failed job's status in Impala, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Login to Hue**: Access Hue with your `temip` user credentials.\n2.  **Navigate to the Job Browser**: Once logged in, navigate to the Job Browser section in Hue.\n3.  **Find the Failed Job**: Locate the failed job that you want to",
        "retrieved_context": "ilter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` fl\nxecuting the script in this case, check if the missing file has been automatically exported in the reconciliation log.\n- Identify system or service errors in the log file e.g failed Impala query.\n- Check if this message exists in the failed execution's log:  \n\t- login on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account  \n\t- `su - mtuser`\n\n    ``` logs\n    [...] - INFO: Nothing to export.\n    ```\n\n    This means that table `sai.voice_raw_v` or `osix.osix_voice_raw` do not contain new data and therefore\nle e.g failed Impala query.\n- Check if this message exists in the failed execution's log:  \n\t- login on `un2.bigdata.abc.gr` with personal account  \n\t- `su - mtuser`\n\n    ``` logs\n    [...] - INFO: Nothing to export.\n    ```\n\n    This means that tables `sai.sms_raw_v` or `osix.osix_sms_raw` do not contain new data and therefore there is nothing to be done during this execution.  \n\n    New data should be loaded in the following tables and then execute the script.  \n\t\t- `sai.sms_raw`, updated by T\ne e.g failed Impala query.\n- Find in the failed execution's log the message:\n\n    ``` logs\n    # e.g for 2022-01-10\n    Problem with 20220108.\n    ```\n\n    This means that table `sai.cube_indicators_it` does not contain new data and therefore there is nothing to be done during this execution. Load table `brond.cube_indicators` first and then execute the script.\n\n\n**Ndefs**:\n\n- If one date was missing the script will catch up at the next execution, assuming the table has been loaded.
