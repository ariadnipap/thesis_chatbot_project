There are two sets of MirrorMakers, one running on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06, and the other running on nodes dr1node01 and dr1node04. The MirrorMakers use specific consumer groups and commit offsets to the respective Kafka clusters.

        "judge_feedback_faithfulness": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot response provides a complex MySQL query to check failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that this query is overly complicated and may not directly address the question asked.\n\nIn contrast, the reference answer provides a straightforward and simple MySQL query that directly answers the question. This query is easy to understand and execute, making it a more practical and effective solution.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 2\n\nThe chatbot response, although attempting to provide a solution, falls short due to its complexity and lack of direct relevance to the question asked. In contrast, the reference answer provides a clear, concise, and directly relevant solution, making it the more appropriate and effective choice. Therefore, the score of 2 is assigned to reflect the chatbot's response as mostly incorrect or containing major factual errors.",
        "judge_feedback_answer_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot's response directly addresses the query by providing a specific SQL command to check failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM. The provided SQL command is detailed and includes conditions such as status = 'FAILED', time intervals, and exception handling, which are all relevant to identifying failed executions within the specified timeframe.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 5**\n\nThe chatbot's response fully meets the requirements of the query by providing a direct, relevant, and complete SQL command to check for failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM. The level of detail and specificity in the provided SQL command demonstrates a thorough understanding of the query's requirements. Therefore, the score of 5 is justified as the response is fully relevant and directly answers the query.",
        "judge_feedback_context_relevance": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe retrieved context provides detailed information about the IPVPN-SM App, its usage of the Monitoring App for recording statistics, and how to query the monitoring DB. It also explains the auto-retry mechanism in case of failed calls to the IPVPN-SM app.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that while the provided context is rich with details about the application, its interaction with the monitoring database, and troubleshooting steps, **it does not directly provide a command or query syntax** for checking failed executions specifically in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM as requested by the query.\n\nTherefore, despite the wealth of information related to the topic, the retrieved context does not precisely answer the question about the specific command to check failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\n**Score: 3**\n\nThis score reflects that while the provided context is somewhat relevant and offers valuable insights into how the IPVPN-SM App interacts with the Monitoring DB, it does not directly address the query's request for a specific command to check failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM.",
        "judge_feedback_groundedness": "### **Detailed Assessment:**\nThe chatbot's response is well-supported by the retrieved context. The provided SQL command directly addresses the query about checking failed executions in the Monitoring database for IPVPN-SM.\n\nThe command filters for failed requests within the last 24 hours, excluding EmptyQuery exceptions, which aligns with the requirements mentioned in the context.\n\nFurthermore, the chatbot's response includes a detailed explanation of how to use the SQL command and what it does, demonstrating a clear understanding of the task at hand.\n\n### **[RESULT]**\nScore: 5\n\nThis score reflects the chatbot's ability to provide a well-supported and relevant response that directly addresses the user's query. The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the context and the requirements specified in the query. \n\nOverall, the chatbot's performance is excellent, providing a high-quality response that meets the user's needs effectively.",
