The application runs in a Kubernetes pod. [Monitoring App](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/common-dev/apps/monitoring/monitoring-devops/-/wikis/home#prod) is used for monitoring and health checks.\n\n**Pod User:** `root`  \n**Pod Scheduler:** `Cron`  \n**Kubernetes Namespace** `piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-deployment`  \n**Cluster User** `ipvpn`  \n**Container Registry** `kubemaster-vip.bigdata.abc.gr/piraeus-cisco-vdsl2-app`  \n**Schedule:** `Every 5 minutes`  \n**Pod Script:** `/app/run_vdsl2.sh`  \n**Main Configuration File:** `/app/conf/application.yaml`  \n**Logs:** Use `kubectl logs` to view `stdout`  \n**Hadoop Table:** `bigcust.vdsl2`\n\n## Application Components\n\n### SNMP Polling of Elements\n\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Piraeus Bank VTUs] -->|SNMP Polling| B[File: nnmcp.vdsl-g*.\\*.txt <br> Path: /app/work/data <br> Pod ]\n```\n\nThe application polls data using SNMP.

The ETL process involves a series of scripts and a Spring Boot application that work together to retrieve, transform, and load data from Impala tables into a remdef server.\n\nThere are three major KPI categories, *Components*, *SLA* and *Interfaces*, which consist of the following subcategories:\n|KPI category|Metrics involved| Relevant Impala tables|\n|---|---|---|\n|Components|CPU, Memory (MEM)|bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node |\n|Interfaces|Interfaces (IF)|bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist,<br>  bigcust.pe_interfaces,<br>  nnmnps.nms_node|\n|SLA|Availability (AV), Quality of Service (QOS)|bigcust.nnmcp_ipvpn_slametrics_hist,<br> bigcust.customer_pl,<br> bigcust.customer_sla_config_ipvpn,<br> bigcust.sla_configurations|\n# Application Flow\n## Scripts & IPVPN-SM App operations\nThe metrics computation of each of the three categories (sla, components, interfaces) is triggered by the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh` script that runs as part of the IPVPN-SLA [cronjob](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/crontab/crontab_per_user.txt), scheduled to run every 5 minutes, and the computation refers to a full five-minute interval.\nThe ETL process follows the following flow:\n\n### IPVPN-SLA\n- [IPVPN-SLA Support Doc](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/applicationFlows/ip_vpn.md)\n\n### IPVPN-SM\n- [IPVPN-SM Dev Wiki](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/home)\n3. The `export_*_kpis.sh` calls the IPVPN-SM App to execute the Impala queries. The curl request to the IPVPN-SM App is executed asynchronously, allowing the IPVPN-SM pipeline to continue with other scheduled 5 min intervals without waiting for the query results.\n4. The IPVPN-SM App executes the Impala queries, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed schema specifications, and sends the results to the SQM server.\n## IPVPN-SM Application\nThe IPVPN-SM Application executes the Impala queries specified in the `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/config/field-mappings.yml`, applies transformations on the result set based on the agreed [schema specifications](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Data-Transmission-Schema) , and sends the results to the SQM server.\n\n### Ingestion Endpoint\nThe endpoint for the IPVPN-SM application is `/ingest-query`. This endpoint should be called with a POST request.\nDetails on the request body fields and examples [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#request-body-1)\n\n### Check application status\n\n```\ncurl --location --request GET 'un-vip:13001/ipvpn-sm/app/status'\n```\n\n## Application Flow Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n  A(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/initiate_export_*.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\") --> B(\"/shared/abc/ip_vpn/run/export_*_kpis.sh <br> ipvpn@un2\")\n  B -- 1.

Their primary purpose is to generate the appropriate input data that is subsequently passed as the body parameter in the POST requests to the IPVPN-SM application.\nThey are invoked by the IPVPN-SLA `export_*_kpis.sh` [scripts](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpnsla-customers-devops/-/blob/master/PROD/nnmnps/bin/export_component_kpis.sh).\n- **Node**: `un2`\n- **User**: `ipvpn`\n- **Scripts**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts`\n- **IPVPN-SM App host & port configured in file** : `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/config.properties`\n- **Logs**: `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log`\n\nThe specific order in which they are called is the following:\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[\"export_*_kpis.sh<br><i>IPVPN-SLA</i>\"] -->B[compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh]\nB -->C[query_sm.sh]\nC --/ingest-query-->D(SM Application)\nstyle A fill:darkgray\nstyle B fill:#ECECEC\nstyle C fill:#ECECEC\n```\n\n## Deployment Instructions\n\nStop/Start guide on [abc_BigStreamer_Apps_MoP_Restart.docx](https://ghi.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/abcBigData/EZsK97GxFyVHkeBoFTFjuRYBtPF7lK86cTA44wMhayNlNA?e=Gjh0ZO)  \nCheck project wiki [here](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/ipvpn/ip-vpn-sla/ipvpn-sm-devops/-/wikis/Application-details#deployment-instructions)\n\n\n## SQM Token Authentication\nThe authentication on the SQM server is done with the HTTP Token Auth in IPVPN-SM application. It requires providing the keystore file, where the token is stored.\n\n# Failure Handling\n## Logs\n\n#### Script Logs on un2\nThe scripts which refresh the Impala tables and which call the IPVPN-SM application write logs under the directories:\n1. The `refresh_*_.sh script` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/refresh_*_kpis`\n2. The `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` Logs\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`\n\nThe asterisk is used to dendef the type of the particular category.\n\n#### Application Logs on un1/un2\nIn case of failure, the logs related to the IPVPN-SM app are the following:\n1. **Access Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/tomcat/access_log.log`\n2. **Application Logs**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/application.log`\n3. **Requests sent to SQM Server**\n`/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-app/deployment/logs/sm-server-requests.log`\n\n#### IPVPN-SLA Logs on `un2`\nAside from the above logs, the operation of the IPVPN-SLA scripts is also monitored by the original implementation.

If the application fails on all 5 attemps, the script exits. On each failed attempt, an email alert is sent via the monitoring app. This operation is done inside the `un2:/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` script.\n\n\n# Support\n\n## Check request status via Monitoring\n### Grafana\nCheck grafana dashboard for failed requests:\n`https://unc1.bigdata.abc.gr:3000/d/HiuaKlU4z/ipvpn-sm-replacement-monitoring?orgId=1&refresh=5s`\n\n### Monitoring DB\nIPVPN-SM App uses Monitoring App in order to record statistics regarding the status of each metric computation request. Querying monitoring DB allows us to investigate pdefntial failed requests.\n1. Connect to monitoring DB\n`mysql -umonitoring -p -h 999.999.999.999`\n2. `use monitoring;`\n\n#### See failed requests in the past 24h excluding EmptyQuery Exceptions\nOften persistent EmptyQuery alerts demand further investigation in the CustomPoller component of IPVPN-SLA application and the associated metrics cannot be retrieved from the Impala tables.   \nTo identify failed metrics in the past 24h due to errors other than EmptyQuery exceptions, we can use the following query\n```\nmysql> select distinct x.job, x.5min_interval_ts, x.sent_to_SQM, y.request_repetitions, x.exception from ( select d.job, DATE_FORMAT( STR_TO_DATE( operative_partition, '%Y%m%d%H%i%s' ), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i' ) as 5min_interval_ts, c.operative_partition, c.status AS 'sent_to_S\nQM', DATE_FORMAT( metric_ts_start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_start, DATE_FORMAT( c.system_ts, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s' ) as metric_ts_end, SUBSTRING_INDEX( c.message, 'com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.ipvpn.sm.exception.', -1 ) as exception from ( SELECT job, compone\nnt as start_comp, status as started, operative_partition as start_oppart, system_ts as metric_ts_start FROM jobstatus WHERE application = \"IPVPN-SM\" and system_ts >= now() -

However the request was successful on the second attempt.\n#### Inspect overall requests' status\nIf we want to check if any of the requests has failed, for instance in the past 24h\n```\nselect application, job,component, operative_partition, status, message, system_ts from jobstatus where application=\"IPVPN-SM\" and component=\"MAIN_END\" and status=\"FAILED\" and system_ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n```\n\n##  Pdefntial Error Cases\n### AppEmptyQueryException\nThis exception occurs when the executed Impala query fails. The underlying reason behind this message can be one the following:\n1. The query did not retrieve any records for the `specified 5min interval`. For category **IF**, this type of failure of a 5min interval may cause the failure of `the following 5min interval` as well. This occurs because an aggregation between two consecutive intervals is performed. \n2. Inability to open one of the HDFS files that constitute a table associated with the particular Impala query.\n3. Unreachable Impala deamon.\n4. Inability to allocate Memory (OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread).\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\nIf the `bigcust` tables are empty, manually adding metrics won't be effective. In such cases, it's crucial to conduct a detailed investigation to pinpoint the specific step within the IPVPN-SLA process where the failure occurred. Such an investigation is documented [here](../procedures/ipvpn_sm_AppEmptyQuery_resolution_MoP.md)\n### SMSystemException\nThe above exception is solely due to SQM server's inability to ingest the information sent by IPVPN-SM App.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMValidationException\nThis occurs in the case when the schema of the data sent does not comply with the agreed schema.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### AppQueryIngestionException\nThis can occur due to inability to apply the particular transformation on the retrieved data.\n**Support Action:** [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n### SMAuthException\nThis occurs if the token used as basic HTTP authentication to the SQM endpoint is rejected.\n**Support Actions:**\n1. [Update keystore with the new credentials](#update-http-auth-token)\n2. [Add metrics manually](#call-the-ipvpn-sm-app-manually-on-un2)\n\n\n## Actions\n### Update HTTP Auth Token\n1. Create keystore\n```\nkeytool -importpass -alias sm_token -storetype JCEKS -validity 365000 -keystore credentials.keystore\n```\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n2. Save the given credentials in the format: `username:password`\n#### Instructions to update the file if given new credentials\n1. Update keystore\n`keytool -keypasswd -keystore credentials.keystore -alias sm_token`\n2. Enter <keystore_pw>\n3. Enter new credentials in the format: `username:password`\n\n### Call the IPVPN-SM App manually on un2\nIn case we want to bypass the scripts running on un2 we can post a request directly on the IPVPN-SM application, either by performing a curl request specifying the [request body](#request-body) details or by running the script `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/scripts/sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh` providing the arguments:\n- `category`, one the valid category types {AV,QOS,CPU,MEM,IF}\n- `reference-start-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm\n- `reference-end-time` in the format yyyyMMddHHmm (inclusive)\n\nThe script will successively call the `refresh_*_.sh` and  `compute_metrics_via_sm_app.sh` scripts for the given category and the period specified by the end and start arguments.\n\n1. In case we want perform the execution for just **one 5m interval**, we provide the same argument for `reference-start-time` and `reference-end-time` fields. E.g. for 5m period of 18/12/2022 10:10:\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181010\n```\n2. If we want to perform requests for **5 multiple consecutive** 5min intervals E.g. for 5m periods of 18/12/2022 10:10 to 10:30 (inclusive):\n\n```\n./sm-replacement-call-repeater.sh CPU 202212181010 202212181030\n```\nThe logs of this operation are appended to the log files in `/shared/abc/ip_vpn/sm-replacement/log/compute_via_sm_app_*`.",

        "retrieved_context": "# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\n\n    Example for day 20220501:\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 20230104 \"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\"\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\n\n        ``` sql\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\n        \"Terminated-Oracle\" state,\n        \"Closed\" problem_status,\n        case when clearancereportflag = \"1\" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\n        handledby as handled_by,\n        closedby as closed_by,\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\n        null previous_state,\n        managedobject as managed_object,\n        targetentities as target_entities,\n        --targetentities60512 as target_entities,\n        alarmtype as alarm_type,\n        eventtime as event_time,\n        probablecause as probable_cause,\n        securityalarmcause as security_alarm_cause,\n        specificproblems as specific_problems,\n        --specificproblems (id)-8eloume to join kai edw,\n        null backed_up_status,\n        backupobject as backup_object,\n        trendindication as trend_indication,\n        thresholdinfo as threshold_info,\n        cast(notificationidentifier as bigint) notification_identifier,\n        correlnotifinfo as correl_notif_info,\n        monitoredattributes as monitored_attributes,\n        proposedrepairactions as proposed_repair_actions,\n        null additional_information,\n        domain as domain,\n        securityalarmdetector as security_Alarm_Detector,\n        null service_User,\n        null service_Provider,\n        ocname as oc_Name,\n        cast(parentalarmobject as bigint) parent_alarm_object,\n        null severity_changed_time_stamp,\n        alarmcomment as alarm_comment,\n        agentalarmidentifier as agent_alarm_identifier,\n        agententity as agent_entity,\n        perceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\n        0 useridentifier,\n        usertext as user_Text,\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\n        null deleted,\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\n        --,*\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\n        ```\n\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \n\n    1. Check if data transferred successfully by running the command below and comparing the result with the number of retrieved records in the logs produced by the script.  \n\n      ``` sql\n      SELECT par_dt, count(*) FROM temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms where par_dt > 'v';\n      Eg.

        "retrieved_context": "# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\n\n    Example for day 20220501:\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 20230104 \"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\"\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\n\n        ``` sql\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\n        \"Terminated-Oracle\" state,\n        \"Closed\" problem_status,\n        case when clearancereportflag = \"1\" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\n        handledby as handled_by,\n        closedby as closed_by,\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\n        null previous_state,\n        managedobject as managed_object,\n        targetentities as target_entities,\n        --targetentities60512 as target_entities,\n        alarmtype as alarm_type,\n        eventtime as event_time,\n        probablecause as probable_cause,\n        securityalarmcause as security_alarm_cause,\n        specificproblems as specific_problems,\n        --specificproblems (id)-8eloume to join kai edw,\n        null backed_up_status,\n        backupobject as backup_object,\n        trendindication as trend_indication,\n        thresholdinfo as threshold_info,\n        cast(notificationidentifier as bigint) notification_identifier,\n        correlnotifinfo as correl_notif_info,\n        monitoredattributes as monitored_attributes,\n        proposedrepairactions as proposed_repair_actions,\n        null additional_information,\n        domain as domain,\n        securityalarmdetector as security_Alarm_Detector,\n        null service_User,\n        null service_Provider,\n        ocname as oc_Name,\n        cast(parentalarmobject as bigint) parent_alarm_object,\n        null severity_changed_time_stamp,\n        alarmcomment as alarm_comment,\n        agentalarmidentifier as agent_alarm_identifier,\n        agententity as agent_entity,\n        perceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\n        0 useridentifier,\n        usertext as user_Text,\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\n        null deleted,\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\n        --,*\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\n        ```\n\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \n\n    1. Check if data transferred successfully by running the command below and comparing the result with the number of retrieved records in the logs produced by the script.  \n\n      ``` sql\n      SELECT par_dt, count(*) FROM temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms where par_dt > 'v';\n      Eg.

        "retrieved_context": "# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run. Format `YYYYMMDD`. It has no significant value to the internal process.\n    - **v1, v2:** Use values for `terminationtimestamp` that are between the start and end of the interval you want to load from Oracle. Format `01-MAY-22`.\n\n    Example for day 20220501:\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 20230104 \"terminationtimestamp>='01-MAY-22' and terminationtimestamp<'02-MAY-22'\"\n    ```\n    The data will be **loaded** into table `temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par`.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n    1. Refresh the staging table in the impala shell:  \n      `refresh temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`\n\n    1. Run the following sql command, which transfers automatically all data to the right partition (par_dt) of temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms:\n\n        ``` sql\n        insert overwrite temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms partition (par_dt)\n        select concat('OPERATION_CONTEXT ',split_part(upper(ocname),':',2),' ALARM OBJECT ', identifier) outentityspec,\n        null last_Modification_Timestamp,\n        split_part(upper(ocname),':',2) operation_context,\n        cast(identifier as bigint) identifier,\n        \"Terminated-Oracle\" state,\n        \"Closed\" problem_status,\n        case when clearancereportflag = \"1\" then true else false end clearance_report_flag,\n        acknowledgementuseride as acknowledgement_user_identifier,\n        handledby as handled_by,\n        closedby as closed_by,\n        handleduseridentifier as handled_user_identifier,\n        releaseuseridentifier as release_user_identifier,\n        closeuseridentifier as close_user_identifier,\n        terminationuseridentif as termination_user_identifier,\n        acknowledgementtimesta as acknowledgement_time_stamp,\n        handletimestamp as handle_time_stamp,\n        closetimestamp as close_time_stamp,\n        terminationtimestamp as termination_time_stamp,\n        releasetimestamp as release_time_stamp,\n        null automatic_terminate_on_close,\n        creationtimestamp as creation_timestamp,\n        archivetimestamp as archive_time_stamp,\n        clearancetimestamp as clearance_time_stamp,\n        null previous_state,\n        managedobject as managed_object,\n        targetentities as target_entities,\n        --targetentities60512 as target_entities,\n        alarmtype as alarm_type,\n        eventtime as event_time,\n        probablecause as probable_cause,\n        securityalarmcause as security_alarm_cause,\n        specificproblems as specific_problems,\n        --specificproblems (id)-8eloume to join kai edw,\n        null backed_up_status,\n        backupobject as backup_object,\n        trendindication as trend_indication,\n        thresholdinfo as threshold_info,\n        cast(notificationidentifier as bigint) notification_identifier,\n        correlnotifinfo as correl_notif_info,\n        monitoredattributes as monitored_attributes,\n        proposedrepairactions as proposed_repair_actions,\n        null additional_information,\n        domain as domain,\n        securityalarmdetector as security_Alarm_Detector,\n        null service_User,\n        null service_Provider,\n        ocname as oc_Name,\n        cast(parentalarmobject as bigint) parent_alarm_object,\n        null severity_changed_time_stamp,\n        alarmcomment as alarm_comment,\n        agentalarmidentifier as agent_alarm_identifier,\n        agententity as agent_entity,\n        perceivedseverity as perceived_Severity,\n        additionaltext as additional_Text,\n        alarmobjectoperatorno as alarm_Object_Operator_Ndef,\n        originalseverity as original_Severity,\n        originaleventtime as original_Event_Time,\n        0 useridentifier,\n        usertext as user_Text,\n        cast(satotal as bigint) sa_total,\n        null deleted,\n        from_timestamp(to_timestamp(terminationtimestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'),'yyyyMMdd') as par_dt\n        --,*\n        from temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par a;\n        ```\n\n        **Ndef:** There are comments that might affect the query if not handled carefully. \n\n    1.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes: REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes:\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    Seems that preauthentication is enforced via `krbTicketFlags`. We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```",

Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf it is not been imported, you should import them using formula  `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain so we can verify that the change is succesfully made. \nVaggos username in our case (enomikos)\n3. Customer should also send a bind user that we will use for groupnet domain configuration.\n4. `/etc/hosts` file at `un5` must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n5.

Update reverse proxy at `un1` so that Groupnet AD can be reached directly from spagobi app.\n\nAdd the following at `un1:/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`\n\n```bash\nlisten def-ad-ldaps\n    bind *:863 ssl crt /opt/security/haproxy/node.pem\n    mode tcp\n    balance     source\n    server def_ad1 PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636 ssl check ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\n```\n\n6. Test and reload haproxy in order changes to take effect\n```bash\n[root@un1 ~]# haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -c\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl reload haproxy\n[root@un1 ~]# systemctl status haproxy\n```\n\n7. Start SpagoBI app:\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# docker start prod-spagobi-7.0.105\n```\n\n8. Check if `enomikos` can sign in. If yes, then go to the next step\n9. Move all users that have domain `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet.gr`\n```bash\n[root@db01 ~]# mysql -u root -p;\nmysql> use spagobi;\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%'; #check existing users that belong to central-domain\nUPDATE SBI_USER SET USER_ID = REPLACE(USER_ID,'@central-domain','@groupnet') WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%';\nselect * from SBI_USER WHERE USER_ID LIKE '%@central-domain%'; #check that no user left to central-domain\n```\n\n> Ndef: Before moving all users at once to the new domain you can first test just one.

Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4.

Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n\n### Update configuration\n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\n\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n\n3. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n# How to change Openldap Manager password\n\nFor every ldasearch the password of `Manager` is [here](KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n1.

If those files are the same then it does nothing, since it means that the file has already been processed by the flow. If the file names are different then it removes the old file in the curr directory and moves the new file from the temp to the curr directory. After that the new file in the curr directory is put in a hdfs path. From there impala queries are executed clearing the pollaploi table, loading the data from the new file and refreshing the pollaploi table. \n\n- **SFTP:** \n   - **Initiator:** `intra` user\n\t- **User:** `bigd`\n\t- **Password:** `passwordless`\n\t- **Server:** `999.999.999.999`\n\t- **Path:** `/energypm/`\n\t- **Compressed File:** `*_pollaploi.zip` containing `*_pollaploi.txt`\n- **Utility Node Directories:**\n\t- **Curr:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`\n\t- **Temp:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_temp`\n  - **Scripts:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi`\n- **HDFS:**\n\t- **Path:** `/ez/landingzone/energy_temp/`\n- **Impala:** \n\t- **Database:** `energy_efficiency`\n\t- **Table Name:** `pollaploi`\n\t- **Retention:** `-`\n- **Logs:**\n  - **Path:** `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log`\n  - **Retention:** `none` (since 15/12/2019)\n\n**_Ndef:_** One of the `impala-shell` queries executed is the `LOAD DATA INPATH <hdfs_path>/<filename>` As seen in this [article](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_load_data.html) the LOAD DATA INPATH command moves the loaded data file (not copies) into the Impala data directory. So the log entry `rm: /ez/landingzone/energy_temp/2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt': No such file or directory` is not something to worry about. \n\n**_[Sample data from pollaploi table](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/blob/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency/TEST%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%A7%CE%95%CE%99%CE%91/2019_05_pollaploi.txt)_** \n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\nDue to the occurance of these tickets (**SD2179931** and **SD2021989**) the below steps should be followed for troubleshooting.\n\n1. Check that a new file `*pollaploi.zip` is placed in the `remdef SFTP directory`. Because the `workflow` runs in the evening (9PM or 10PM), if a file is placed earlier in the remdef SFTP directory and the client asks why it hasn't been loaded, wait until the next day and follow the steps mentioned here to see its execution.\n\n1. Check that a file `*pollaploi.txt` exists in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr`.\n\n1. Based on the `date` the file has in `/shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr` check the log file `pollaploi.<YYYYMMDD>.log` of that specific day. E.g. \n\n    ```\n    $ ls -l /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/pollaploi_curr/\n    > -rw-r--r-- 1 intra intra 1034132960 Mar 22 18:34 2023_03_01_pollaploi.txt\n    $ less /shared/abc/energy_efficiency/load_pollaploi/log/pollaploi.20230322.log\n    ```\n1. In `Hue` go to `Jobs` and search `energy` in the search bar. View the last executed `workflow` and see if it has run successfully.   \n\n### Possible Response to Ticket\n\n**_Ticket:_**\n``` \nGood morning,\nthe new pollaploi file has been uploaded but the corresponding table has not been updated yet\nThank you.\n```\n\n**_Response:_** (example)\n```\nGood evening.\nThere seems to be no new file in the sftp directory /energypm. The workflow that loads the table runs every day at 9PM/10PM, so if a file is added today it will be loaded in the evening. The last file that has been loaded is named 2023_03_01_pollaploi and from the logs on 2023-03-22 it seems to have been loaded normally.\n```\n## Useful Links\n\n- **[GitLab Repo](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/bigdata/abc/reporting/reporting/-/tree/master/FLOWS/energy_efficiency)**",

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different.

Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4.

Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section\n# GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords\n\n- [GROUPNET - Change bind users' passwords](#groupnet---change-bind-users-passwords)\n  - [RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind](#ranai-geolocation---t1-svc-cneranaibind)\n  - [R-Studio Connect - t1-svc-cnebind](#r-studio-connect---t1-svc-cnebind)\n    - [Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect)\n\nThe purpose of this document is to describe the procedure on how to change the passwords for the bind users used for querying the LDAP of GROUPNET domain.\n\n## RAN.AI Geolocation - t1-svc-cneranaibind\n\n1.

Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\n    ``` bash\n    vi  /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg\n    # Update **BindPassword** with the password obtained in step 3 and save\n    ```\n\n5. Restart R-Studio Connect\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl restart rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n6. Check R-Studio Connect status\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n7. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n8. Due to the fact that the server is not directly connected to the Internet, R-Studio Connect might display an error about expired license after the reboot. In this case follow the steps listed [below](#re-activate-license-for-r-studio-connect).\n9. Inform users that the application is available.\n\n### Re-activate License for R-Studio Connect\n\n1. Login to `unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr` as root via Cyberark\n2. Ensure that time is accurate and the time zone is correct for the machine.\n\n    ```bash\n    timedatectl\n    ```\n\n3. Sync date and time to hardware clock of the machine.\n\n    ``` bash\n    hwclock -w\n    ```\n\n4. Deactivate license\n\n    ``` bash\n    export http_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    export https_proxy=http://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:5555\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager deactivate\n    ```\n\n5.

In case you  receive the following\n\n   ``` text\n   Error activating product key: (13): The activation has expired or the system time has been tampered with. Ensure your time, timezone, and date settings are correct. If you're sure the license is not expired, try performing the following steps, in order: \n   1. Fix the timezone on your system.\n   2. Fix the date on your system.\n   3. Fix the time on your system.\n   4. Perform a system restart (important!)\n   ```\n\n   Fix any time/date issues and **reboot the server**.\n\n7. Verify license status\n\n    ``` bash\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager status\n    /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager verify\n    ```\n\n8. Restart R-Studio Connect\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl restart rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n9. Check R-Studio Connect status\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n10.

Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@un5 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf it is not been imported, you should import them using formula  `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain so we can verify that the change is succesfully made. \nVaggos username in our case (enomikos)\n3. Customer should also send a bind user that we will use for groupnet domain configuration.\n4. `/etc/hosts` file at `un5` must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n5. Perfom an ldap search for the given bind user. \n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# ldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -D \"t1-svc-cnebind\" -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" '(sAMAccountName=enomikos)'\n```\n\n\n### Backup\n\n1.

The alerts pertain to two categories: IF (Interface Metrics) and CPU/MEM (CPU and Memory Metrics).\n\n## Affected Alerts\n1. IF Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:50:00`.\n2. CPU/MEM Alerts:\n   - Occurred for 5-minute intervals starting from `2023-10-12 14:30:00` until `2023-10-12 14:45:00` and then for `2023-10-12 14:55:00` & `2023-10-12 15:00:00`.\n\n## Resolution Steps\n\n### Resolution for IF Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Review the CSV file loading process into HDFS for errors:\n   - Connect to `ipvpn@un2` and navigate to the log file:\n     ```\n     ssh root@un2\n     su ipvpn\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/interfaces_flow/Dataparser/scripts/log/nnm_interface_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n   - The last loaded CSV file was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `2023-10-12 14:28:00`. No files were loaded from that point until 14:50, with the message: \"File '/home/custompoller/nnm_interface_metrics/InterfaceMetrics*.csv.gz' not found.\"\n3. Verify the transfer process on `nnmprd01` for errors:\n   - Connect to `nnmprd01` via passwordless SSH from `un2`:\n     ```\n     ssh custompoller@nnmprd01\n     ```\n   - Review the transfer log:\n     ```\n     tail -f /home/custompoller/export_metrics/log/transfer-new-files-cut.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last file moved from the source directory to the destination directory on `nnmprd01` was `InterfaceMetrics_20231012142500238.csv.gz` at `14:28:01`. This continues until `14:50`, aligning with the observations in the `bigcust.perf_interfacemetrics_ipvpn_hist` table.\n\n#### Conclusion for IF Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the IF alerts.\n\n### Resolution for CPU/MEM Alerts:\n1. Check `bigcust.nnm_ipvpn_componentmetrics_hist` table to confirm the missing data for the mentioned 5-minute intervals.\n2. Examine the SFTP transfer process from `nnprd01` for errors:\n   - Navigate to the log file on `ipvpn@un2`:\n     ```\n     tail -f /shared/abc/ip_vpn/log/nnm_component_metrics.cron.20231012.log\n     ```\n     The last SFTP transfer was for the file `BIG-CUSTOMERS-CPU-MEM-UTIL_20231012142323337.csv.gz` at `14:26`. Subsequently, the logs show the message \"No file found.. sleep and try again..\" until `14:58`, when a CSV file was found.\n\n#### Conclusion for CPU/MEM Alerts\nNo files were generated by NNM during the intervals when we received the CPU/MEM alerts.\n# Streamsets\n\n**Utility Node / Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`  \n**User:** `sdc`  \n**[Password](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx)**   \n**Logs:** `/shared/sdc/log/sdc.log`  \n**Log Retention:** `10 days`  \n**Configuration:** `/shared/sdc/configuration/pipelines.properties`  \n**Streamsets:** `https://un2.bigdata.abc.gr:18636`  \n**Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n\n## Streamsets Flows\n\n`Streamsets Flows` are used for getting files from sftp remdef resources, processing them, storing them into HDFS directories and loading the file data into Hive and Impala tables. The tables are partitioned based on the file name which contain a timestamp (e.g. \\*\\_20181121123916.csv -> par_dt='20181121'). \n\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n    C[Remdef Sftp Server]\n    A[SFTP]

Restart R-Studio Connect\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl restart rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n9. Check R-Studio Connect status\n\n    ``` bash\n    systemctl status rstudio-connect\n    ```\n\n10. Verify LDAP authentication by logging in to [https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect](https://unrstudio1.bigdata.abc.gr/connect)\n<b>Description:</b>\n\n```\nThis document describes the procedure of changing current domain from `central-domain.root.def.gr` to `groupnet` along with their users\n\nServer:\n\nPVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr\n\nUseful info:\n\nPROD\n- https://999.999.999.999/connect/\n- unrstudio1\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Check if the ssl certificates of the groupnet have already been imported\n\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# openssl s_client -connect PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr:636\n```\n\nIf they are not been imported, you should import them using formual at `admin:etc/salt/salt/tls/certificate_authority/import_ca.sls`.\n\n2. Customer should send an active user that belongs to the new domain for testing \n3. `/etc/hosts` file must be updated to all  BigStreamer servers with the new domain \n4. Perfom an ldap search for the given user:\n```\nldapsearch -H ldaps://PVDCAHR01.groupnet.gr -W -b \"dc=groupnet,dc=gr\" -D \"<Bind User sAMAccountName>\" '(sAMAccountName=...)'\n```\n\n### Backup\n\n1. Back up `rstudio-connect-central.gcfg`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# cp -ap /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-central.gcfg\n```\n2. Backup database directory `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/`\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# tar -zcvf var_lib_rstudioconnect_db.tar.gz /var/lib/rstudio-connect/db/\n```\n\n### Update configuration\n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. Edit `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`\n\nYou can find new configuration at: `[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect-groupnet.gcfg`\n\nValues that must be changed:\n- ServerAddress\n- UserSearchBaseDN\n- GroupSearchBaseDN\n- PermittedLoginGroup #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- BindDN\n- BindPassword\n- PublisherRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- ViewerRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n- AdministratorRoleMapping #This value must be set according to the ouput of previous ldap search\n\n3. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n4. Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user.\n\n\n### Rstudio Lisence\n\nRStudio Connect has a limit for the number of active users it can serve. Currently, the license we have, can serve only 40 active users.\n\nWhat can you do though in case you want to add another user but there are not free licenses? \n\n**Only after getting customer's confirmation you can delete another user that it is not used**\n\n### Delete user\n\n1. In order to use `/opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users` command you must first stop RStudio connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n\n2. List existing users\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users\n```\n3. Let's assume that we want to delete `dsimantir` account. Let's find his GUID.\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv dsimantir\n```\n\nOutput must be something like below:\n\n| GUID  |  ID | Username   |  First |  Last  |  Email   |   Role |  DN  | UniqueID  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7  | 16  |  dsimantir  |   |   | dsimantir@uatdef.gr  | publisher   | CN=dsimantir,OU=def_users,DC=uatdef,DC=gr  |  EQGFgRGDt0KZ9sAipdlzhw== |\n\n4. Delete user\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager delete --users --user-guid e633e5b9-cbc3-4fb3-8c3b-19ba4aa617b7\n```\n\n5. Verify that user is deleted by re-running step 3 and make sure that there is no ouptput.\n6. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n7. You can also verify that the user is deleted by login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People \n\n\n### Transfer projects/context from one user to another in case of duplicate users\n\nIn our case, when we changed `central-domain` to `groupnet` we noticed that when users logged in to the `groupnet` domain they were not able to see their projects.\n\n\nThat issue occurred due to the fact that name, email and other attributes where different to `central` and `groupnet`. For example:\n- \u03a7\u03a1\u03a5\u03a3\u039f\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u039f\u03a3 Charisis, ccharisis@def.gr -> central domain\n- \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, CCHARISIS@abc.GR -> groupnet domain\n\n> Ndef: Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user\n\nAs a result, the user was considered as different account and a different registration was created.\n\nSo, how can merge those two accounts? \n\n1. Stop rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl stop rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n2. Find id of above duplicate users:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager list --users | grep -iv ccharisis\n```\nLet's assume that the id of ccharisis in central domain is 7 and the id of ccharisis in groupnet is 145\n\n3. Transfer account from `central-domain` to `groupnet` using following command:\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/usermanager transfer -source-user-id 7 -target-user-id 145\n```\n4. Start rstudio-connect\n```bash\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl start rstudio-connect\n[root@unrstudio1 ~]# systemctl status rstudio-connect\n```\n5.  Login to https://999.999.999.999/connect/ with the active user account > People > Search for the specific user and check the contents of the duplicate user have been transferred\n\n6. Delete user that belongs to `central-domain` as described in previous section",

It appears to be focused on replacing an InfiniBand card, decommissioning and recommissioning a node in Cloudera Manager, fixing interface configurations, and troubleshooting Streamsets Java Heap Space issues. Therefore, I am unable to provide steps for restarting the Cloudera CDSW system based on this context.",
        "retrieved_context": "# InfiniBand Replacement\n\nReplacing an IB card require powering off the host. Before doing so some checks must be performed and the host\nmust be decommissioned. After replacing, some configurations must be performed in the interfaces and the roles\nrecommissioned.\n\n## Decommission\n\nTo decommission the node from Cloudera Manger, select the specific host and:\n1. Enter maintenance mode\n2. Select decommission roles\n3. If a datanode role is present on this host, take it offline for at least 4 hours\n\n## Check for non-default IB partitions\n\nMost probably only the default IB partitions are present. To check this perform the following steps provided\nby Oracle:\n```\nNdef:\nIf a system uses custom non-default InfiniBand partitions [e.g., Exalogic (virtual/physical/hybrid), Exadata (virtual/physical), SuperCluster, BDA] then the HCA Port GUIDs might need to be updated in the InfiniBand partition(s) after replacing an HCA.\n\nDetermine the switch running as Primary. From it, check for any custom, non-default IP partitions.\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# sminfo\nsminfo: sm lid 15 sm guid 0x10e0406d5aa0a0, activity count 26263191 priority 14 state 3 SMINFO_MASTER\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ibnetdiscover | grep 10e0406d5aa0a0\nswitchguid=0x10e0406d5aa0a0(10e0406d5aa0a0)\nSwitch 36 \"S-0010e0406d5aa0a0\" # \"SUN DCS 36P QDR bdax01sw-ib1 xxx.xxx.171.24\" enhanced port 0 lid 15 lmc 0\n\n[root@bda01node05 ~]# ssh root@xxx.xxx.171.24\n\n[root@bda01sw-ib1 ~]# smpartition list active\n# Sun DCS IB partition config file\n# This file is generated, do not edit\n#! version_number : 0\nDefault=0x7fff, ipoib : ALL_CAS=full, ALL_SWITCHES=full, SELF=full;\nSUN_DCS=0x0001, ipoib : ALL_SWITCHES=full;\n\nIf there are IB partitions other than default partitions, then refer to MOS ndef 1985159.1 for additional steps that will need to be taken before the old HCA is removed.\n```\n- [MOS ndef 1985159.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?parent=SrDetailText&sourceId=3-37179888534&id=1985159.1)\n\nIf `smpartition list active` shows output similar to the above, no actions are needed. If not the attached procedure must followed in order to replace the UUIDs.\n\n## Fix Interface\n\nOracle runs an automated configuration scripts that sets arp checking of the gateway in certain interfaces. If\nthe interfaces are non-routable, as is the case for bondeth1 and bondeth2, these options must be removed.\n\n1. Check for any interfaces that should not be in the DOWN state with `ip a`\n2. ssh into another known with known good configs\n3. compare the interfaces in question with the interfaces in the changed hosts and remove\n   any option not present in the known-good node. Generally these would be options referring to ARP.\n4. Bring the interfaces down with `ifdown <IFCACE_NAME>`\n5. Bring it back up with ``ifup <IFCACE_NAME>``\n6. Check if the interfaces are in the UP state with `ip a`\n7. Check that ARP entries are complete with `arp`\n\n## Recommission\n\nRecommission the node through cloudera manager. Recommissioning and starting roles in the same step might\nfail so it is best to recommission first without starting roles.\n\n1. Recommission without starting roles\n2. Start roles\n\nAfter everything is back online the kudu tablet on the host might not have taken on any tablets. This\nis normal as all tablets have been replicated to the other hosts. With time it will take on tablets as\nwell.\n\nThis can be verified using `ksck` as the kudu user.\n# Streamsets - Java Heap Space\n\nStreamsets Java Heap Memory was increased due to [this](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/issues/102#ndef_95081) issue.\n\nActions Taken:\n\n1.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication.

We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```",

        "question": "How do I check if the Kafka and Kudu services are running before decrypting a disk?",
        "category": "Application Functionality & Flow",
        "expected_answer": "To check if Kafka and Kudu are running, navigate to Cloudera Manager and:\n1. Go to `Kafka > Status`.\n2. Go to `Kudu > Status`.\nEnsure they are stopped before proceeding with disk decryption.",
        "chatbot_response": " To check if the Kafka and Kudu services are running before decrypting a disk, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Cloudera Manager.\n2. Check the status of Kafka by navigating to Kafka > Status.\n3. Check the status of Kudu by navigating to Kudu > Status.\n\nIf both services are running, you will see an \"Running\" or \"Started\" status for each service. If either service is not running, you will need to start it before proceeding with decrypting the disk. \n\nIn your case, since you don't have data in the partition, you can skip stopping Kafka and Kudu services as mentioned in >Ndef_2. However, it's still a good practice to verify their status before proceeding with the decryption process. \n\nSo, to summarize: check the Cloudera Manager for the status of Kafka and Kudu, and make sure they are stopped if you have data in the partition, or skip this step if you don't have data as per >Ndef_2. Then proceed with decrypting the disk by following the remaining steps outlined in the procedure. \n\nI hope that helps!

        "retrieved_context": "# TeMIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `abc TeMIP alarms live feed to BigStreamer` application is a Java application hosted on a Wildfly application server. The objective of the application is to receive and store (in near real time) the TeMIP alarms (from specific TeMIP Operation Contexts) into the BigStreamer\u2122 ecosystem. The `Apache Kudu` storage engine was selected in order to achieve near real time CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The `Apache Impala` is used for extended data retention (6 months). The `Apache Oozie` scheduler  is used in order to automatically run the necessary scripts.\n\n- **Ndef:** All the needed **passwords** can be found [**here**](https://metis.ghi.com/obss/oss/sysadmin-group/support/-/blob/master/KnowledgeBase/abc/devpasswd.kdbx).\n\n## Flows\n\nThe `TeMIP Flow` consists of 4 components/flows:\n1. Initialization/Synchronization flow\n1. Main Application flow\n1. Move Kudu to Impala flow\n1. Alert Mail flow\n\n### Main Application\n\nThe `Main Application Flow` contains our `TeMIP application` deployed to the `Wildfly Server` which receives the TeMIP alarms and stores them into Kudu tables.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[TeMIP Server] \n  B[Wildfly Server]\n  A --> |Sends TeMIP alarms| B\n  B --> |Stores TeMIP alarms| D[(Kudu Storage Engine)]\n  D --- E[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms]\n  D --- Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  D --- K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  style A fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **TeMIP Server**\n  - **Host:** `999.999.999.999`\n  - **Port:** `7180`\n- **Wildfly Server**\n  - **Servers:**\n    - `temip1 (999.999.999.999)` Standby Server\n    - `temip2 (999.999.999.999)` Active Server\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Installation Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/`\n  - **Deployments Path:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/deployments`\n  - **Application Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/server.log`\n  - **Access Logs:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/log/access.log`\n  - **Configuration:** `/opt/wf_cdef_temip/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/config/`\n    - **File:** `temip.properties`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Mail executed by [Alert Mail](#alert-mail)**\n  - **Subject:** `\"[ Temip ] No alarms available.\"`\n  - **Body:** `\"There are no Temip alarms  available for the last hour. Corrective action may be needed.\"`\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check `logs` (application and access) with `temip-tailog` for any `ERROR` message that can occur.  \nIf TeMIP Server is running correctly, we should see lines like the following:  \n`INFO [com.jkl.bigstreamer.abc.temip.core.service.TemipService] (default task-173) Counter= 3064020, handle= 968, batchName= batch_2, timesRestartedFromLastSync= 1, aoExtractDataList size= 1`\n1. Check if `TeMIP Server` is up by executing `ping 999.999.999.999`.\n1. Contact a `TeMIP admin` to see if there are any server side related issues\n\n### Initialization/Synchronization\n\nThe `Initialization/Synchronization Flow` consists of an OOZIE Coordinator called `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`. The coordinator is responsible for establishing the **connection** and **communication** of the `Wildfly Server` (containing our TeMIP Application) with the `TeMIP Server`.\n\nEvery time the `Main Application` is successfully deployed to `Wildfly Server` or gets restarted, this `coordinator` **must be run manually** to initiate the above procedure, it does not happen automatically. If the `Wildfly Server` is up and running, the `coordinator` executes on specific days of every month to perform maintenance tasks.\n\n``` mermaid\n  flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B -->|REST message protocol| C[Main Application]\n  C <--> |SOAP message protocol| D[TeMIP Server]\n  style C fill: #45b39d\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `2,7,12,17,22,27 of every month at 03:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `45 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/100.TeMIP_Synchronization_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/101.temip_synchronization_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/102.temip_synchronization.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check logs for any errors\n1. If workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` has been run manually, login to `Hue` with `temip` user `after 45 minutes` and execute the following `impala query` editor: `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`.  \nIt should return `15 rows`. If not, re run the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow\n\n### Move Kudu to Impala\n\nThe `Move Kudu to Impala` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO` which executes once a day and is responsible for moving the alarms from kudu to the equivalent impala table.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Job] \n  Z[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms]\n  K[Kudu: temip.temip_kudu_historic_events]\n  A --> Z\n  A --> K\n  Z --> |Move older alarms to impala|H[Impala: temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms]\n  K --> |Move older events to impala|L[Impala: temip.temip_impala_historic_events]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Coordinator**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `everyday at 06:00 local time`\n    - **Approximate Duration:** `15 minutes`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF`\n      - **Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/temip_kudu_to_impala.sh`\n      - **Logs:** `Through Oozie Job in HUE`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check that workflow `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` runs successfully. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user and selecting `Jobs`. Then filter the jobs with `user:temip` and look for a `job` with the below properties:\n    - **Name:**  `oozie:launcher:T=shell:W=temip_kudu_to_impala:A=shell-661a:*`\n    - **Type:** `Oozie Launcher`\n    - **Execution Time:** `06:00 AM`\n\n    Select the desired shell execution, view its logs and search for any ERRORS.\n1. After the root cause of the problem has been identified, re-rerun the failed execution. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user.\n\n### Alert Mail\n\nThe `Alert Mail` flow consists of a coordinator called `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO` which runs every hour and checks if the application receives any alarms from the TeMIP Server. The `TeMIP Server` sends alarms continuously. If in the last hour, the application has not detected any new alarms, an email is sent to jkl Engineers to inform that there might be a issue. The check is performed by comparing the number of alarms from the previous execution stored in `temip.temip_alert_table` table with the current one.\n\n``` mermaid\n flowchart TD\n  A[OOZIE Server] -->|SHELL Action as user temip| B[un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr <br> User: temip]\n  B --> C[201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh]\n```\n\n- **Oozie Scheduler**\n  - **Hue:** `https://un-vip.bigdata.abc.gr:8888`\n  - **User:** `temip`\n  - **Coordinator:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    - **Execution:** `every hour`\n    - **Workflow:** `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF`\n      - **Master Script:** `hdfs:/user/temip/200.TeMIP_Alert_Mail_Oozie_Main.sh`\n      - **Remdef Script:** `un-vip/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/201.temip_alert_mechanism_Main.sh`\n      - **Server:** `un2.bigdata.abc.gr`\n      - **SSH User:** `temip`\n      - **Logs:** `un-vip:/shared/abc/temip_oozie_production_scripts/log/202.temip_alert_mechanism.$(date '+%Y%m%d').log`\n\n**Alerts:**\n\n- **Not Monitored**\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\n1. Check for any failed executions. This can be done through accessing `Hue` with `temip` user\n1. Check for any cluster related problems during the failed execution.\n\n## Manual Actions\n\n### Restart Wildfly Server\n---\n\n**_Ndef:_** TEMIP runs only in one node. Second node is in standby mode.\n\n1. **Only if requested by TeMip Administrators** In `Hue` with `temip` user, clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;`\n1. `Shutdown Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Execute `/bin/bash` and then run `temip-stop` to stop wildfly and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Suspend the temip Coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Clear table `temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms` by executing `delete from temip.temip_kudu_active_alarms;` in `Hue` as `temip` user \n\n1. `Startup Wildfly Server`\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`.\n    1. Start wildfly by executing `/bin/bash` and then running `temip-start` and check logs with `temip-tailog`.\n    1. Resume the three temip coordinators (`Hue` with `temip` user):\n        - `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Synchronization_CO`\n        - `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_CO`\n    1. Workflows:\n        - The two workflows `TeMIP_kudu_2_Impala_WF` and `TeMIP_Alert_Mail_WF` should run automatically when oozie scheduler detects that it was suspended.\n        - The third workflow `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` should be run manually. Specifically, `login` as `temip` to `Hue` and run manually with no parameters. Make sure that it will not also be executed by the corresponding coordinator.\n    1. At `HUE` with `temip` user, open the impala editor and execute the following command in order to refresh e-mail alert script:  \n      `insert overwrite temip.temip_alert_table values(1);`\n\n1. `Sanity Checks`\n\n    1. Login as `temip` user in `temip2`\n    1. Check `logs` with `temip-tailog` and search for any errors.\n    1. After `45 minutes`, login to `Hue` with `temip` user and execute the following impala query editor:  \n    `select * from temip.temip_kudu_configs`  \n      It should return 15 rows. If not, `re run` the `TeMIP_Synchronization_WF` workflow.\n    1. Login to `Hue` with `temip` and perform the below impala queries with a temip admin (Ioanna Bekiari) in order to established if everything is running okay. If the results are the same or really similar, the synchronization is considered successful.\n\n        ``` sql\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ENM_BASEBAND%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS2G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%ERICOSS-LTE%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NOKIA3G%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%.ATHENS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%NNM_FIXED%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%U2000-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%1350OMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%HUAWEI_IMS%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%AUMS-OC%';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '.def.A5529.A5520_AMS-OC';\n        select count(*) from temip_kudu_active_alarms where operation_context like '%2000_DSLAM%';\n        ```\n\n### Load Terminated Alarms from TeMIP Oracle Database In case of data loss\n---\n\nIn case there is a loss of alarms for any reason, eg our application or TeMIP outage, we may be asked to load historical data directly from TeMIP Oracle Database into our terminated alarms table. In order to start this operation we must wait for some days, so that all alarms are transferred to the Oracle table. Whole procedure is described in detail below:\n\n1. Wait `7 days` from the day you want to `re-load` in order for terminated alarms to be refreshed in Oracle table.\n\n1. Connect as `temip` in `un2` and run `ping 999.999.999.999`, in order to see if `Temip Server` is up and running.\n\n1. From impala shell `secimp`(as `temip` in `un2`) or `Hue`(as `temip`):\n\n\t1. Check missing partitions in `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` and `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarm` by running  \n  `select count(*), par_dt from <database>.<table> where par_dt='<partition>' group by par_dt;` on both tables.  \n\t\tWe receive TeMIP alarms every day. So if there are general ERRORS(logs) or we have partitions containing less alarms than usual(eg. count), it suggests that there might be problems with the TeMIP server or our application and in need of investigating.\n\n\t1. Delete existing wrong partitions that overlap with the required interval, either from kudu table `temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms` or from impala table `temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms`.\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in kudu table (only 10 most recent days are in kudu), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_kudu_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS RANGE PARTITION 'v1'<= values < 'v2';`,   \nwhere v1 and v2 the required interval.\n\n\t\t- If wrong partitions are contained in impala table (10 days past the current date), do:  \n`ALTER table temip.temip_impala_terminated_alarms DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION (par_dt='v');`,   \nwhere v is the wrong partition.\n\n\t1. In order to not tranfer again old data that have remained, run `truncate table temip.temipdb_term_alarms_load_par;`.\n\n1. As `temip` in `un2` Run the script with arguments\n    ``` bash\n    sh /usr/icom/scripts/Sqoop_Oracle_HDFS_Impala_Load_TeMIP_v832.sh \"temipaharchi.alarmobject0\" identifier 30 <current-pardt> \"terminationtimestamp>='v1' and terminationtimestamp<'v2'\"\n    ```\n    - **current-pardt:** is the `today` par_dt, the day the script is run.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes: REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes:\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    Seems that preauthentication is enforced via `krbTicketFlags`. We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```\n# Benchmarking HBASE on Lab with YCSB Tool\n\n## Introduction\n\nOur purpose was to run performance tests on a created Hbase table on Lab environment and document the results which will be used as a point of reference to evaluate the efficacy of quotas that will be applied. After running tests with no quotas, we run the same tests after setting firstly read throtttle quotas and secondly write quotas. We implemented the following procedure on jakarta node (999.999.999.999). Kinit with hbase keytab was a prerequisite.\n\n## Hbase table creation\n\n- Created an hbase table using pre-splitting strategy to ensure write operations target region servers uniformly\n  \n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 * number of regionservers, in our case 3 regionservers)\n    create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}}\n    ```\n\n## Installing YCSB Tool and system configuration\n\n- Get latest release of ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz from https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/tag/0.17.0 on jakarta\n- Unzip file\n    ```bash\n    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz\n    ```\n- Specify a HBase config directory containing  hbase-site.xml\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p  /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cd /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml .\n    ```\n- Get to YCSB directory\n    ```bash\n    cd ycsb-0.17.0\n    ```\n\n## Performance tests on Hbase with YCSB before setting quotas\n\n- Load the data\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb load hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family\n    ```\n- Execute the workload requesting a time series with 1 sec granularity and directing output to a datafile\n    ```bash\n    bin/ycsb run hbase20 -P workloads/workloada -cp /HBASE-HOME-DIR/conf -p table=usertable -p columnfamily=family -p measurementtype=timeseries -p timeseries.granularity=1000 -s > workloada.dat\n    ```\n- Delete and recreate table to repeat the aforementioned steps with workload{b-f} changing workload and datafiles respectively\n  ```bash\n  hbase shell\n  disable 'usertable'\n  drop 'usertable'\n  exists 'usertable'\n  n_splits = 300\n  create 'usertable', 'family', {SPLITS => (1..n_splits).map {|i| \"user#{1000+i*(9999-1000)/n_splits}\"}\n  ```\n## Create namespace and set throttle quotas\n\n- Create namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    create_namespace 'quotas_test'\n    list_namespace\n    ```\n- Create table in the namespace\n    ```bash\n    hbase shell\n    n_splits = 300 # HBase recommends (10 *

How to fix openldap replication\n\nThe broken replication between `kerb1`/`kerb2` could happened in case any of the below cases appeared/happened.\n\n- Case 1: You changed the `Manager` password of openldap instance\n- Case 2: Replication broken for any other reason (power outage etc) between `kerb1` and `kerb2`\n\nFor every ldasearch the password of `Manager` is [here](KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n# For Case 1 follow the below steps:\n\nLogin into kerb1 node as root\n\n```bash\nssh kerb1\nsudo -i\n```\nBackup:\n\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0 -l config.ldif\nslapcat -n 2 -l data.ldif\n```\nCreate ldif file replication fix\n\n```bash\nvi replication_config.ldif\n\ndn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config\nchangetype:modify\nreplace:

\"cn=config\" -W -f replication_config.ldif\nldapmodify  -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=config\" -W -f replication_config.ldif\n```\n\nChecks:\n\nCreate a new user on ldap kerb1 via `UI` with name `testuser`:\n\nLogin into admin node as root:\n\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: (https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/)\n\n# Steps to create an ldap user\n\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3. Click `create a new entry here`\n4. The type of account will be `User account`\n5. Fill all the empty boxes. \n6. The user will be `no login` and the group/gid `disabled`\n7. Create object\n\nAfter succesfully creation of `testuser` check if exist on `kerb2` from the dropdown menu or via ldapsearch\n\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=testuser'\n```\n\nIf user exist then replication fixed. Just delete the `testuser`.\n\n# Steps to delete an ldap user\n\n1. Connect with username `cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr` and password from `kdbx` file.\n2. Expand tree `people`\n3. Check the new user and from the right bar click `delete this entry`\n\n\n# For Case 2 follow the below steps:\n\nIdentify which `kerb` ldap instance has the issue. For example check if they had the same ammount of `users` and `groups` with `ldapsearch` commands from checks\n\nFrom the `kerb` ldap instance without corruption :\n\n```bash\nslapcat -n 0  config.ldif\nslapcat -n 1 data.ldif\n\nscp *.ldif `ldap_instance_with_corruption`:/tmp\n```\nGo to corrupted `kerb` instance:\n\nBackup:\n```bash\ncp -rp /etc/openldap/ /tmp/openldap.bak\ncp -rp /var/lib/ldap/ /tmp\n```\n\nClear:\n```bash\nsystemctl stop slapd\nsystemctl status slapd\ncd /etc/openldap/\nrm \u2013Rf slapd.d\ncd /etc/openldap\nmkdir slapd.d\ncd /var/lib/ldap/\nrm \u2013Rf *\n```\nRestore:\n```bash\nslapadd -n 0 -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -l /tmp/config.ldif\nslapadd -n 2 -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -l /tmp/data.ldif -w\n```\nOwnership:\n```bash\nchown -R ldap:ldap /var/lib/ldap\n```\nStart `slapd` service:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start slapd\nsystemctl status slapd\n```\n\nChecks:\n\nCreate a new user on ldap kerb1 via `UI` with name `testuser`:\n\nThe procedure to create a new user described [here](/KnowledgeBase/abc/BigStreamer/supportDocuments/procedures/openldap_change_manager_password.md)\n\nLogin into admin node as root:\n\nOpen firefox\n```bash\nfirefox\n```\nphpldapadmin link: (https://kerb1.bigdata.abc.gr/phpldapadmin/)\n\nAfter succesfully creation of `testuser` check if exist on `kerb2` from the dropdown menu or via ldapsearch\n\n```bash\nldapsearch -H ldaps://kerb2.bigdata.abc.gr -D \"cn=Manager,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\" -W -b \"ou=People,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\"  'uid=testuser'\n```\n\nIf user exist then replication fixed.

In this short guide, it explained how you can repair the replication on the MySQL slave. This guide is for MySQL.\n\n### Glossary\n\n- MYSQL replication: It is a process that enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to copied automatically to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)\n\n## Setup\n\n### Mysql Instances\n\n#### PR\n\nMysql supported by Oracle and if any other issue occured a critical ticket should created on Oracle Support. **This instance is not supported by jkl Telecom S.A.**\n\n**User**: `mysql`\n\n**Port**: `3306`\n\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n**Master Mysql Host**: `pr1node03.mno.gr`\n\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `pr1node02.ngr.gr`\n\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n\n#### DR\n\n**User**: `mysql`\n\n**Port**: `3306`\n\n**Password**: [prodsyspasswd.kbdx](/KnowledgeBase/prodsyspasswd.kdbx)\n\n**Master Mysql Host**: `dr1node03.mno.gr`\n\n**Slave Mysql Host**: `dr1node02.mno.gr`\n\n**Mysql Configuration**: `/etc/my.cnf`\n\n**Mysql Data Path**: `/var/lib/mysql/`\n\n**Mysql General Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld.log`\n\n**Mysql Error Log File**: `/var/log/mysqld_error.log`\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Identify the problem\n\n1. From **Slave Mysql Host** as `root`:\n\n      ```bash\n      mysql -u root -p\n      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\\G;\n      ```\n\n2.

Replication between the two nodes is performed on the LDAP service using GSSAPI authentication (Kerberos) using `ldap/_HOST` Service Principal Names (SPNs). It is a \"push\" replication, so each change is propagated to the other instance from the instance that it was performed.\n\nEach KDC uses the LDAP on the same host as backend, so since both LDAP Servers are replicated between the two instances (active-active) KDCs are up to date with between the two hosts.\n\n```mermaid\n  graph LR\n  A[idm1.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  B[idm2.bigdata.abc.gr<br>SPN: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr]\n  A-->B\n  B-->A\n```\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Check replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage list -v # List replication targets of idm1\nipa-replica-manage list -v idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and show if it managed to push it's changes to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nidm1.bigdata.abc.gr: replica\n  last update status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded\n  last update ended: 2023-12-21 12:41:17+00:00\n```\n\n### Force replication\n\n``` bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1\nkinit <admin user>\nipa-replica-manage force-sync  --from idm2.bigdata.abc.gr # This will connect to idm2 and schedule an immediate sync (push) to the local instance (idm1)\n```\n\n```log\nipa: INFO: Setting agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config schedule to 2358-2359 0 to force synch\nipa: INFO: Deleting schedule 2358-2359 0 from agreement cn=meToidm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=replica,cn=dc\\=bigdata\\,dc\\=abc\\,dc\\=gr,cn=mapping tree,cn=config\nipa: INFO: Replication Update in progress: FALSE: status: Error (0) Replica acquired successfully: Incremental update succeeded: start: 0: end: 0\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n:warning: All problems in this section have been solved and all actions mentioned below have been reverted as part of obss/oss/sysadmin-group/abc/BigStreamer/bigstreamer#53 \n\n### A brief history of preauthentication\n\nPreauthentication is authentication of the client to the KDC when requesting a Kerberos ticket. This means that instead of issuing an `AS-REQ` the client issues a `TGS-REQ` which is logged in KDCs' logs.\n\nWe will not include specific preauthentication protocols in this presentation. Feel free to research them.\n\n### A brief history of errors\n\n_At the time of writing we cannot replicate the issue to get accurate log entries, but we can give you is accurate commands for the investigation_ :smile:\n\nWhen we failed over the Cloudera Services from `CNE.abc.GR` to `BIGDATA.abc.GR` we faced a problem with users coming from `CNE.abc.GR` not being able to login to Cloudera Services.\n\nTo resolve the issue we issued the following command, that disables preauthentication for SPNs:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you are on idm1 and have valid admin Kerberos ticket\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"KDC:Disable Default Preauth for SPNs\"\n```\n\nThis resolved our issue, but created two new problems:\n\n1. SPNs do not require preauthentication, but `krbtgt/BIGDATA.abc.GR` requires preauthentication. This means that if you `kinit` with an SPN `kinit -R` will refuse to run with the dreaded `NO_PREAUTH`. This is problematic for the Hue Kerberos Renewer. As a workaround we are renewing the Kerberos ticket cache of Hue via `cron`.\n2. Replication from `idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` to `idm1.bigdata.abc.gr`. The error is the error is also `NO_PREAUTH`. This means that `ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr` was rejected by `ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr` due to the lack of preauthentication. Let's inspect the service principals:\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm1.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 128\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    ipa service-find ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr --all --raw\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    -----------------\n    1 service matched\n    -----------------\n      dn: krbprincipalname=ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbcanonicalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      krbprincipalname: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      managedby: fqdn=idm2.bigdata.abc.gr,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      ipaKrbPrincipalAlias: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n      ...\n      krbPwdPolicyReference: cn=Default Service Password Policy,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      krbTicketFlags: 0\n      memberof: cn=replication managers,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=bigdata,dc=abc,dc=gr\n      objectClass: ipaobject\n      objectClass: top\n      objectClass: ipaservice\n      objectClass: pkiuser\n      objectClass: krbprincipal\n      objectClass: krbprincipalaux\n      objectClass: krbTicketPolicyAux\n      objectClass: ipakrbprincipal\n    ----------------------------\n    Number of entries returned 1\n    ----------------------------\n    ```\n\n    `krbTicketFlags` seems to be different. Checking the same principals from `kadmin` interface:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes: REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"get_principal ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr\"\n    ```\n\n    ```log\n    Principal: ldap/idm2.bigdata.abc.gr@BIGDATA.abc.GR\n    Expiration date: [never]\n    ...\n    Attributes:\n    Policy: [none]\n    ```\n\n    Seems that preauthentication is enforced via `krbTicketFlags`. We can remove it by issuing the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    kadmin.local -q \"modify_principal -requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\" # This is also replicated to idm2, since pushing from idm1 to idm2 worked\n    ```\n\n    Now replication works.\n\nWhen `CNE.abc.GR` is removed we will re-enable preauthentication with the following command to resolve the issue with Hue:\n\n```bash\nkadmin.local -q \"modify_principal +requires_preauth ldap/idm1.bigdata.abc.gr\"\nipa config-mod --ipaconfigstring=\"\"\nipactl restart\n```",

        "question": "How is Kafka mirroring implemented for redundancy in the Online Banking system?",
        "category": "Infrastructure & Deployment",
        "expected_answer": "Kafka mirroring is implemented using Kafka MirrorMaker. Each site produces messages to a topic with the `-mir` suffix, which is then mirrored to the final topic without the suffix. PR and DR sites use MirrorMakers at specific nodes (e.g., `pr1node01.mno.gr` for PR and `dr1node01.mno.gr` for DR) to replicate data between sites, ensuring redundancy.",
        "chatbot_response": " Kafka mirroring is implemented using MirrorMaker, which replicates data from one Kafka cluster to another. This ensures that data is available in both the primary and disaster recovery sites, providing redundancy and high availability for the Online Banking system.\n\n    Additionally, the implementation includes multiple MirrorMakers running on different nodes, with each MirrorMaker responsible for replicating a specific set of topics. This distributed approach helps to ensure that the mirroring process can handle large volumes of data and provide low-latency replication between the primary and disaster recovery sites.\n\n    The Kafka mirroring implementation also includes features such as automatic offset management, which ensures that the MirrorMakers can correctly track the offsets of the messages they are replicating. This feature helps to prevent issues such as message duplication or loss, which could occur if the MirrorMakers were not able to correctly manage the offsets of the messages they are replicating.\n\n    Overall, the Kafka mirroring implementation provides a robust and reliable solution for replicating data between the primary and disaster recovery sites, helping to ensure high availability and redundancy for the Online Banking system.",
        "retrieved_context": "# Manage Kafka MirrorMaker\n\n## Scope\n\nKafka MirrorMaker has been configured with auto.offsets.reset=false. This means that the MirrorMaker consumers never commit the offsets.\nIf the MirrorMakers' consumer group goes inactive(both MirrorMakers are offline at the same time), their consumer group will reset to the earliest offset available.\nThis means that the last week will be mirrored to the final topic and will be replayed by the Spark streaming topology.\nThis document describes how to commit the offsets for the MirrorMaker consumer groups, in order to avoid this issue.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node01 and pr1node04:\n\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n2. MirrorMakers on nodes pr1node05 and pr1node06:\n  \n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Primary Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n3. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node01 and dr1node04:\n\n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Disaster Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-002** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Disaster Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n4. MirrorMakers on nodes dr1node05 and dr1node06:\n  \n    - Replicate the traffic from the **Primary Site Mirror Topics** to the **Disaster Site Final Topics**.\n    - Replicate Production Topics for both Internet Banking and Online Applications.\n    - Use **mir-trlog-ingest-stream-con-001** consumer group.\n    - Offsets are committed to the **Primary Site Kafka cluster**.\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Stop Kafka MirrorMakers for PR site\n\n1.

The requests originate from the backend servers of Internet Banking. Requests are loadbalanced by NetScaler (Loadbalancer) that is managed by mno's networking department. The events are then sent to a Kafka topic. Usually only one site is active (Primary Site).\n\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[Online Backend Servers] -->|HTTP Requests| B[Load Balancer - Netscaler]\n  B -->|Active| C[pr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -->|Active| D[pr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| E[dr1edge01.mno.gr]\n  B -.->|Stopped| F[dr1edge02.mno.gr]\n  C -->|Kafka Producer| G[Primary Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  D -->|Kafka Producer| G\n  E -.->|Stopped| H[Disaster Site's Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  F -.->|Stopped| H\n```\n\n**User**: `PRODREST`\n\n**Installation Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston`\n\n**Deployments Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston/standalone/deployments`\n\n**General Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`\n\n**Application Configuration Path**: `/opt/wildfly/default/prodreston/standalone/configuration/BigStreamer/beanconfig/translogApiOnlineJmxConfig.xml`\n\n**Application Logs**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/server.log`\n\n**Access Log**: `/var/log/wildfly/prodreston/access.log`\n\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_wildfly.md)\n\n**Instructions for migrating traffic to DR site**: [Here](../procedures/failover.md)\n\n**Alerts**:\n\n- [PR][ONLINE] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [DR][ONLINE] REST Endpoints Average Response Time\n- [PR][ONLINE] Ingestion Average Error rate\n- [DR][ONLINE] Ingestion Average Error rate\n\n**Troubleshooting Steps**:\n\n- Check application logs for error messages.\n- In case there are many errors in the application logs, try to restart the problematic Wildfly instance with the provided instructions.\n- If the logs do not indicate a specific problem, check for any problems regarding Kafka performance.\n\n### Kafka Mirrorring\n\nAfter being published to Kafka, the traffic is mirrored to the opposite site via Kafka MirrorMaker. In order to be able to have both Sites active at any given time and simplify the failover procedure the each Site produce messages to a topic with the suffix `-mir`. The topics with the `-mir` suffix contain events published to the Site. The `-mir` topics are then copied via Kafka MirrorMakers to the final topics (no `-mir` suffix), that has all the messages from both Sites.\n\n#### PR replication\n\n```mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node01.mno.gr/pr1node04.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream]\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> pr1node05.mno.gr/pr1node06.mno.gr| G[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream]\n\n```\n\n#### DR replication\n\n``` mermaid\n  graph TD\n  A[pr1edge01.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C[PR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  B[pr1edge02.mno.gr] -->|Kafka Producer| C\n  D[dr1edge01.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream-mir]\n  E[dr1edge02.mno.gr] -.->|Stopped| F\n  F -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node01.mno.gr/dr1node04.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream]\n  C -->|Kafka MirrorMakers <br> dr1node05.mno.gr/dr1node06.mno.gr| H[DR Site Kafka: prod-trlog-online-ingest-stream]\n```\n\n**MirrorMaker User**: `kafka`\n\n**Configuration**: Cloudera Manager\n\n**Logs**: Cloudera Manager\n\n**Instructions for start/stop**: [Here](../procedures/manage_mirrormaker.md)\n\n**Alerts**:\n\n- Cloudera Manager alerts regarding Kafka\n\n### Spark Streaming\n\nAfter being sent to the final Kafka topic, the records are consumed by two separate Spark Streaming topologies\n\n#### Prod_Online_IngestStream\n\nThis topology takes all records from the final Kafka topics, extracts some values and writes them to a Kudu table.
